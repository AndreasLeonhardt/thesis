\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we investigate magnetic properties of Iridates, 
compounds that contain orthorombic Iridium and can be described by the Hubbard model for effective spins.
We use a mean field approach to calculate the dynaimc magnetic susceptibility for certain components.
They are compared to measurements and other models, mainly Heisenberg models. 

We found the Hubbard model with up to third-neighbour interactions to provide results that agree well with experiment.

\chapter{Introduction}

% remember: there will be an abstract, that contains some introdcutory blabla.
Iridates is the name for a group of anorganical chemical compounds that contain oxydized Iridium.

% interesting examples here
These materials gained a lot of attention in the last decade due to their variety of interesting configurations.
Due to their configuration of an Iridium ion surround by several oxygen anions, they can be described as effective spin systems.
Therefore they are a realization of interesting theretical models such as the Hubbard and the Heisenberg model.
Some of the compounds have a layered structure, leading to low-dimensional systems.


Iridates share a lot of properties with the cuprates. 
Ever since high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) was discovered in cuprates, 
they were intensively investigated. 
Due to the chemical similarity of irdium to copper, it is possible to create materials that share the same geometry as the ones known from cuprates.
Replacing copper with irdium yields interesting effects due to their physical differneces.
The higher charge of the iridium nucleus for example enhances the spin-orbit coupling in the active orbitals.
This creates interesting new effects when embedded in a pervoskite structure, as it is the case in the iridates.
%
% same shit, different try
%
Iridium and Copper have similar chemical properties. 
Iridates are therefore quite similar to Cuprates. 
The later one are intensively investigated ever since high temperature superconductivity was first realized in doped cuprates in 1986 \cite{}.
Both are strongly interacting, which makes them a Mott-insulator at half filling.
Since Iridium is a heavier element some of the parameters are different for Iridates. 
Due to the larger charge of the nucleus, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is enhanced in Iridates compared to cuprates.
This creates new effects and changes the macroscopic behaviour. 
We find Iridates that behave like soin$\frac12$ systems with half filled bands. 


%They are promising candidates to provide a realization of theoretical models.

The term was coined in resemblance of cuprates, a similar group of materials with Copper instead of Iridium.
% However, both terms are not strictly defined and may include some exceptions with non-ionic bounds.
Cuprates are intensively investigated since the 1980s, when high temperature superconductivity was first realized in Cuprates.


Here we refer to a certain subclass of these materials, where ions of Iridium and Copper respectively are embedded in an octahedron of oxygen ions.
Depending on their geometries, these materials show a wide range of interesting effects.
They provide a realization of two-dimensional spin systems with strong interactions.

The research on Iridates, both experimentally and theoretically, became an area of intesiv research in the recent years. 
Their share a lot of features with the Cuprates, since Iridium and Copper are almost identical in their chemical properties. 

However, since Iridium is a heavier element, its compounds show new features that differ from the ones known from cuprates.
The most interesting effect is the enhanced spin-orbit coupling due to the heavier nucleus.
By this, the replacement of Copper by Iridium might have drastic on the macroscopic behaviour. 
One example is a transition from the conductor to an Mott-insulator in Sr$_2$XO$_4$, 

Depending on the orientation of these octahedra, the number of oxygen ions shared between two octahedra varies for different materials. 





\section{Motivation}

% Why are Iridates interesting
% - similar to Cuprates, and they pffer a variety of materials with interesting properties, such as HTSC. 
% - - similar chemical configuration, but higher Z lead to :
% - - stronger Spin-Orbit coupling might introduce new effects. (\lambda \propto Z^4)
% - geometric structure: layered and therefore effective 2D systems (pervoskite)
% -- pervoskite structure and SOC create effective spin-$\frac12$ systems
% -- different geometries of spin sites: rectangular, triangular, realization of Kitaev Model.
% -outline doping?
% theoretical point of view: Playground for Hubbard model


% approach outline: 
% -Describe as spin system
% -treat in mean field approach (taken from cuprates)
% -calculate observables and compare to experiment for specific material(s)
% -determine parameters of model (basically U)
% - show that this is a reasonable approach worth for further usage.
% -compare models: Hubbard vs. Heisenberg, 
%  -or since Hubbard $\stackrel{U\rightarrow }infty}{\longrightarrow}$ Heisenberg, is Heisenberg sufficient, valid, good?
% - find ground state: Mott insulator vs … ? 

% What could be done with that? 
% engineering of Kitaev model & other stuff?
% HTSC for doped Iridates?

% controversy about:
% -Mott insulator (paper) (see above)
% -parameters, especially U
% -if HTSC is possible

\section{Outline}

First the characteristic configuration of the crystal is  investigated.
We will see, how Iridium embedded in an octahedron of oxygen ions  with strong  SOC
creates states with an effective total angular momentum of $J=\frac32$ and $J=\frac12$.
While all $J=\frac32$- states are occupied, the later ones are half filled in the undoped case.
They form the active band, which allows us to proceed to a pure spin model using the tight binding approximation.
We introduce  correlations through on-site repulsions. 
This so called Hubbard interaction is the simplest way of accounting for interactions 
and has been shown to provide a good description in similar systems, e.g. the cuprates.
% $t-U$ and $t-t^{\prime}-t^{\prime \prime}-U$
% octa

We then solve the Hubbard model in the mean field approach.
The goal is to calculate the dynamical magnetic susceptibility.
From this we can extract the spin wave dispersion, which 
can be directly compared to results from neutron and X-Ray scattering experiments.
We follow the calculation scheme by  \citet{PhysRevB.65.132404} that was used for the structurally similar cuprate La$_2$CuO$_4$.

The calculations will first be carried out in the large U limit and compared to the results of linear spin waves in a Heisenberg model.
Since the Heisenberg model can be dervied from the Hubbard model in this limit, we can use this to validate the calculations.

We then calculate the dispersion with parameters from Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ for different band structures.
The results were compared to measurements on this material. 
The interaction parameter $U$ is the only adjustable parameter in this approach and will be fitted to give the best match to observations.
We show that the approach outlined above provides results that agree well with measurements and is capable of reproducing the main features of the dispersion.

\section{Iridates}
% proper definition of iridates in section above
Iridium is one of the rarest metals on earth and highly corrision-resistant. 
It belongs to the transition metals, i.e. its $d$ shell is only partially filled.  
Iridium in the atomic configuration has the shell structure $[\mathrm{Xe}]4f^{14}5d^7 6s^2$.
% ${\mathrm{Sr}}_{2}{\mathrm{IrO}}_{4}$
In compunds it can be found in different oxidation states, ranging from -3 to +6.
In the compounds treated in this thesis iridium is fourfold oxidized to $\mathrm{Ir}^{4+}$, 
which removes the $6s^2$ electrons as well as two electrons from the $5d$ shell.
The outermost shell is therefore the $5d$ shell, which is half-filled ~\cite{Abragam70}.


%(the ion shell structure does not follow the Aufbau principle. 
%Therefore has $\mathrm{Ir}^{4+}$ a different shell structure than Tantalum, even though they have the same number of electrons. 
%This is because of the different charge of the nucleus, that leads to a greater seperation in energs levels with different quantum number n ($\propto \frac{Z}{n^2}$)).

The other elements of the compounds treated in this thesis are oxygen and rare earth metals. 
The oxygen is two fold ionized and has therefore only the closed shells $1s^2,2s^2,2p^6$.
The same hold for the rare earth metals, strontium is reduced to 
$\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ with the electron configuration of $\mathrm{Kr}$. 
Both the rare earth metal and oxygen have therefore zero total angular momentum and spin. 

Iridates show a great variety of geometrical configurations. 
We will focus on Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, which is part of the Ruddelson-Popper series of Iridium oxides, Sr$_{n+1}$Ir$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ with $n =1$. 
Other possible values in this series are 2 and $\infty$.
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ has the structure of a layered perovskite, that means it consists of layers with a structure similar to CaTiO$_3$.
The later one is also called perovskite and lends its name to the perovskite structure.
It consists of a cubic unit cell, with one type of atom, here Ca on the edges. 
The other atom, Ti, is embedded in an octahedron of 
oxygen ions, which are located on the face centers.
%
%
In the case of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ it is Ir$^{4+}$ that is located  inside the octahedra. 
The type of rare earth metal as well as the ratio determine different geometrical setups of octahedra. 
They share corners only in the $x$-$y$-direction while beeing separated by a Sr$^{2+}$ ion in the z-direction.
Due to a shift between two subsequent layers, we have to include two layers in the unit cell in order to regain a cubic one.
An octahedron of one layer matches an Sr ion of the other, perventing  corner sharing in the $z$-direction and providing thereby the separation of layers. 
% 
Furthermore, the octahedra are tilted in a staggered pattern by $\Theta = \pm 11^{\circ}$ \cite{PhysRevB.49.9198}.
This enlarges the cubic unit cell to $\sqrt2 a\times\sqrt 2b \times 2c$.
In $x$- and $y$-direction we have to take two irdium ions into the unit cell. The translation vector corresponds now to the former diagonals.
At the same time we get 4 layers in $z$-direction, until the same pattern of tilted octahedra is met again. 
%
We will neglect the rotations in proceeding to an model of effective spins, but regain the influence it has on the magnetic structure in the final interpretation of 
response functions. It shows that these rotations provide an explanation for the small ferromagnetic moment in the otherwise antiferromagnetic material. 
\todo{picture of Sr2IrO4 unit cell, take from \cite{PhysRevLett.108.177003} if needed, meausered ferromagnetic moment}

\subsubsection{Ligand Field}

The $5d$ states  in a free iridium ion are degenerate due to rotational symmetry of the atomic Hamiltonian. 
We represent them by the states $x^2-y^2,z^2,xy,xz,yz$, which are related to the spherical harmonics $Y^2_m$ for $m=0,\pm1,\pm2$ by a unitarian transformation.
As such, they all have angular momentum $l=2$. 
and they form an irreducible representation of the rotation group.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
 \hline
 $xy$ & $\frac{\im}{\sqrt 2} \left( Y^{-2}_2 - Y^2_2 \right)$ & $\sqrt{\frac{15}{4\pi}} \frac{xy}{r^2}$ \\
 $xz$ & $\frac{  1}{\sqrt 2} \left( Y^{-1}_2 - Y^1_2 \right)$ & $\sqrt{\frac{15}{4\pi}} \frac{xz}{r^2}$ \\
 $yz$ & $\frac{\im}{\sqrt 2} \left( Y^{-1}_2 + Y^1_2 \right)$ & $\sqrt{\frac{15}{4\pi}} \frac{yz}{r^2}$ \\
 $z^2$& $ Y^0_{2} 					      $	& $\sqrt{\frac{15}{4\pi}} \frac{3z^2-r^2}{2r^2\sqrt 3} $\\
 $x^2-y^2$&$\frac1{\sqrt 2} \left( Y^{-2}_2 + Y^2_2 \right) $ & $\sqrt{\frac{15}{4\pi}} \frac{x^2-y^2}{2r^2} $ \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
Embedding the ion in a crystal breaks the rotational symmetry and the degeneracy of these states will be lifted.
Since the ion is now surrounded by oxygen ions, the so called ligands, in the form of an octahedron, the 
full rotational symmetry is reduced.
Due to the geometry of the ligands, the potential is symmetric under transformations, that map an octahedron or equally a cube on itself.
These transformation build the group $O_h$.
Comparing the characters of the irreducible presentations for  $O_h$ with the ones for for the full rotation group, we find that 
the later one has to split up into two subgroups, 
the three-fold degenerate $t_{2g}$ states consisting of the $xy,xz,yz$ orbitals and the two-fold degenerate $e_g$ states $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ \cite[Chapter~4]{Tinkham64} 
% this is just a very short outline, can, but doesn't need to be explained further.
% in the latter case, a nice reference AND NUMBER would not hurt.
\todo{quantify + reference, hybridization of orbitals} 
The $e_g$ states are higher in energy than the $t_{2g}$.
An intuitive way to see this is the form of the orbitals, where the $t_{2g}$ levels avoid the negative oxygen ions, reducing therefore repulsion. 
For a strong crystal field, as we have in these materials, the $e_g$ states are well above the Fermi level and are therefore unpopulated,
in contrast to a weak crystal field, where orbitals are filled according to Hund's rule, i.e. one electron in each orbital with parallel spins.
In the case of iridium we deal with  $5d$ states, which are more extended than the $4d$ and $3d$ states of lighter transition metals. 
This reduces the repulsion between electrons, which further helps favouring double occupancies in the $t_{2g}$ over filling the $e_g$ states.
Finally, the $t_{2g}$-states contain all 5 electrons belonging to the $d$-shell.




\section{Strong Spin-Orbit Coupling}


Until now we neglected interactions between angular momentum and spin. 
The coupling $\lambda$ of total angular momentum $L$ and total Spin $S$ is proportional to the charge of the nucleus in 4th power, $Z^4$.
Spin orbit coupling (SOC) becomes therefore more important in heavier elements and is no longer negligible in iridates.
Strong SOC is the main difference between iridates and cuprates.
It is the reason for interesting new effects like the insulating behaviour up to high temperatures. 

The total effective angular momentum of the $t_{2g}$-states is $L=1$. 
There are five electrons in the three states, leaving one hole.
Due to the Pauli principle, only three electrons can have the same spin, 
the other two have the opposite spin. 
The total spin $S$ is therefore $\frac12$.
The total angular momentum and total spin can be coupled to
$J=\frac32$ and $J=\frac12$.
These states are energetically separated, depending on the strength of the coupling. 
%
SOC is introduced by adding the term $\lambda \sum_{i} \hat{\vec L} \cdot \hat{\vec S}$ to the Hamiltonian.
The matrix elements are given by 
\begin{equation}
\bra{\alpha,\sigma} \hat{\vec L} \cdot \hat{\vec S} \ket{\beta,\sigma^{\prime}} = \sum_{j=x,y,z}\bra{\alpha} \hat L_j \ket{\beta} \bra{\sigma} \hat S_j \ket{\sigma^{\prime}} 
\end{equation}
with $\alpha, \beta \in \{xy,xz,zy\}$ and the spin values $\sigma, \sigma^{\prime} \in \{\uparrow,\downarrow\}$.
% notation of \sigma as number
The angular momentum matrix elements can be easily calculated by the substitution $L_x=\frac12 (L^++L^-)$ and $L_y=\frac{-\im}2 (L^+-L^-)$.
and expressing the $t_{2g}$-states through the spherical harmonics.
The components of the angular momentum operators act on the spherical harmonics through 
$L_z Y^m_l = m Y^m_l \:$, $L^+Y^m_l = \sqrt{(l-m)(l+m+1)}Y^{m+1}_l$ and $L^-Y^m_l = \sqrt{(l+m)(l-m+1)}Y^{m-1}_l$.
The components of the spin operator are proportional to the Pauli matrices, $\tau_j = \frac12 \sigma_j$.
We are left with a hermitian matrix with only six independent, non-zero components, namely
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \bra{zx,\sigma} \hat{\vec L} \cdot \hat{\vec S} \ket{xy,-\sigma} &=& \frac{\im\lambda}2 \nonumber \\
 \bra{yz,\sigma} \hat{\vec L} \cdot \hat{\vec S} \ket{xy,-\sigma} &=& -s_{\sigma}\frac{\lambda}2 \nonumber \\
 \bra{zx,\sigma} \hat{\vec L} \cdot \hat{\vec S} \ket{zx,\sigma}  &=& s_{\sigma} \frac{\im \lambda}2,
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
where $s_{\uparrow}=+1$, $s_{\downarrow}=-1$ denote the signs of the spins.
This matrix has two eigenvalues, $-\nicefrac{\lambda}2$ and $+\lambda$. The subspace for the lower one is 4 dimensional and corresponds to 
the $J_{\mathrm{eff}}=\frac32$ state, the other one is the two-dimensional $J_{\mathrm{eff}}=\frac12$ subspace. 
In the ground state the $J=\frac32$ band will be completly occupied, while the $J=\frac12$ band is half-filled.
Figure \ref{split_states} shows the energetic split and the occupancy of energy levels in the ground state.

\section{The Hubbard Model}

So far we considered only ions and their immediate vicinity in limit of infinite separation from each other, i.e. without interactions between different sites in the crystal.
In reality the orbitals will overlap and create thereby the possibility of transitions and interactions.
In this chapter we provide an outline on how to construct a set of localized orthonormal states, that allow us to describe our system in second quantization.


\subsection{Tight Binding Model} % in second quantization

Electrons in iridates are localized, i.e. they are well described by wave functions, which are centred around sites in the crystal and vanish fast as one is moving away. 
In this case, atomic orbitals provide a good starting point. 
Since we are interested in dynamics at low temperatures we restrict ourself to the $J=\frac12$ orbital, that is situated at the Fermi level. 
Other orbitals are either completely filled or well above the Fermi level and therefore not important in the dynamics of the system at low temperatures.


We denote the $n$th orbital of the unit cell at site $\vec R_i$ with $\ket{\phi_I} = \phi^n(\vec r - \vec R_i)$.
$I=(n,i)$ is the combined index of orbital number $n$ and site number $i$. $n$ runs over the relevant orbitals of all atoms in the unit cell. 
%
Even though the orbitals are localized, we have a non-zero overlap for different $I=(i,n)$ and $J=(j,m)$, $\braket{\phi_I}{\phi_J} = S_{IJ}\ne \delta_{IJ}$.
This includes overlap in the unit cell and across sites. 
%
The potential in the Hamiltonian is now the sum over atomic potentials at all sites, and the total single-particle Hamiltonian reads
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \hat H &=& \frac{1}{2m}\nabla^2 - \sum_I V^n_{\mathrm{atom}}(\vec r - \vec R_i ) \nonumber \\
 &=& H_{\mathrm{atom}}^n(\vec R_i) - \sum_{J\ne I} V^m_{\mathrm{atom}}(\vec r - \vec R_j )
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
In the last line we grouped the terms belonging to the single atom Hamiltonian at space $\vec R_i$, of which $\ket{\phi_I}$ is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue $E^n$.
This allows us to easily identify different contributions the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian.
\begin{equation}
 \bra{ \phi_I} \hat H \ket{\phi_J} = E^{m}S_{IJ}-\beta^{m}\delta_{IJ} - T_{IJ}
\end{equation}
$\beta^m$ corresponds to a shift of energy, due to the integral over the atomic potentials located on all sites apart $I$,
\begin{equation}
 \beta^m = \int \!\!\dint^3 r \:\: \phi^n(\vec r - \vec R_i)^* \sum_{I^{\prime}\ne I} V^{n^{\prime}}_{\mathrm{atom}}(\vec r - \vec R_{i^{\prime}} ) \phi^n(\vec r - \vec R_i)
\end{equation}
This contribution will be small, since the $\ket{\phi_I}(\vec r)$ is small at $\vec r$ where the potential is big. 
The matrix $T_{IJ}$ consists of all non-diagonal integrals of this type, 
\begin{equation}
 T_{IJ} = \int \!\!\dint^3 r\:   \: \phi^{n*}(\vec r - \vec R_I) \sum_{I^{\prime}\ne I} V^{n^{\prime}}_{\mathrm{atom}}(\vec r - \vec R_{i^{\prime}} ) \phi^m(\vec r - \vec R_j)
\end{equation}
if $I \ne J$ and 0 otherwise. 
The biggest contribution in the sum comes from the term with $I^{\prime}=J$, since one wave function has a central overlap with the potential.

We want to transform our basis states such, that they are orthonormal but still located around lattice sites.
Functions of this type are the Wannier functions $\Psi_I$. They are given by the Fourier transformation of Bloch functions.
\begin{equation}
 \Psi_I \left( \vec{r} \right) = \frac1{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vec{k}} \euler^{\im \vec{k}\vec{R}_i } \Psi_K(\vec r) 
\end{equation}
We introduced the combined index for $k$-space as well, $K=(n,\vec k)$
Bloch functions are eigenfunctions of the translation operator of the lattice. 
Under a symmetry translation of the lattice, they will only pick up a phase,
\begin{equation}
 \Psi_{K} \left( \vec{r}+\vec{T}\right) = \euler^{\im \vec{k} \vec{T} } u_{K} \left( \vec{r} \right). \label{BlochDef}
\end{equation}
$\vec T$ is a translation vector of the lattice and $u_{K} \left( \vec{r} \right)$ is a function with the same periodicity as the lattice. 
As eigenfunctions of the translational operator the Bloch states are orthogonal, 
which can also be seen by the completeness relation of $\sum_i \euler^{\im ( \vec k - \vec k^{\prime} ) \vec R_i} = N\delta (\vec k - \vec k^{\prime})$
Since the transformation to Wannier states is a unitary transformation, it follows immediately that they are orthogonal as well.

We can now construct Bloch functions from the atomic functions by means of Bloch sums.
\begin{equation}
  \Psi_K(\vec{r}) = N_K \sum_{i} \euler^{\im \vec{k}\vec{R}_i }  \phi^n(\vec{r}-\vec{R}_i). 
\end{equation}
$N_K$ is a $k$- and $n$-dependent normalization factor, which we choose to be real, since we need only it's absolute value.
\begin{equation}
 N_K^{-2}  = \big| \sum_{i,j} \euler^{\im \vec k (\vec R_i-\vec R_j)}  
 \underbrace{\int \!\! \dint^3 r {\phi^n}^*(\vec r - \vec R_i) \phi^n(\vec r- \vec R_j)}_{S_{(n,i),(n,j)}} \big|
\end{equation}
Constructed in this way, the states fulfil the requirement of \ref{BlochDef}, since
\begin{equation}
 \Psi_{K}(\vec{r}+\vec{T}) 
 = N_{K} \euler^{\im \vec{k} \vec{T} } \sum_{i} \euler^{\im \vec{k} (\vec{R}_i-\vec{T})} \phi^n (\vec{r}-\vec{R}_i+\vec{T}) 
 = N_{K} \euler^{\im \vec{k} \vec{T} } \sum_{i} \euler^{\im \vec{k}\vec{R}_i }  \phi^{n}(\vec{r}-\vec{R}_i), 
\end{equation}
where the second step is simply done by a shift in the sum. 
Using the Bloch sums to construct Wannier functions yields the states we are looking for.
These so called Löwdin orbitals are given by
\begin{equation}
 \ket{\varphi_I} = \sum_{j}  \sum_{\vec k} \euler^{\im \vec k ( \vec R_i - \vec R_j ) } N_k \ket{\phi^J}\delta_{mn} = \sum_{J} \mathbf A_{IJ}\ket{\phi_J}\delta_{mn} .
\end{equation}
We introduced the transformation matrix $\mathbf A$, which can be expressed as a product of matrices itself.
Therefore we write the Fourier transformation as 
$\mathbf U_{IK} = \euler^{\im \vec k \vec R_i}\delta_{mn}$, which is unitarian. 
We rewrite the normalization constant as a diagonal matrix, $\mathbf N_{KK^{\prime}}= N_{K} \delta_{KK^{\prime}}$. 
The inverse is again a diagonal matrix with the inverse elements on the diagonal, which gives
$\mathbf N^{-2} = \mathbf U \mathbf S \mathbf U^*$.
The total expression for $\mathbf A$ is therefore
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf A = \mathbf U(\mathbf U^*\mathbf S\mathbf U)^{-\frac12}\mathbf U^* = \mathbf S^{-\frac12}.
\end{equation}
Finally, we can express the Löwdin states in term of atomic orbitals and their overlaps,
\begin{equation}
 \ket{\varphi_I} = \sum_J (\mathbf S^{-\frac12})_{IJ} \ket{\phi_J}\delta_{mn}.
\end{equation}
The matrix $\mathbf S^{-\frac12}$ is defined by a Taylor series of the matrix $\mathbf S$. 
Therefore they commute and hermitian and $\mathbf S^{-\frac12}$ is hermitian.
Since we have only small off-diagonal elements and 1 on the diagonal, we see that the Löwdin states are still
localized around the centres. 
In the limit of large separations, $\mathbf S$ approaches the identity, and we regain the atomic orbitals.
The main difference between the Löwdin states and the atomic ones are imaginary oscillations, that ensure orthogonality.


We can now express the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in the new basis.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \bra{ \varphi_I} \hat H \ket{\varphi_J} &=& (E^m-\beta^m)\delta_{IJ} - t_{IJ} \\
 t_{IJ} &=& \left\{ 
 \begin{array}{c@{\quad}l}
 -\beta \mathbf S_{IJ} - (\mathbf{S}^{-\frac12}\mathbf T \mathbf S^{-\frac12})_{IJ} & I \ne J \\
 0 & I=J 
 \end{array} \right. \nonumber 
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
%
The calculation of $t_{IJ}$ requires detailed knowledge about the atomic states and the periodic potential.
They are usually calculated through other approximation schemes, for example the local density approximation (LDA).
In calculations we will use values from the literature, that were fitted to LDA + SO calculations.


\subsubsection{Superexchange}
% and how spin exchanges happen 

The direct hopping terms between iridium orbitals are negligible, since the iridium sites are separated by oxygen ions.
Transitions between iridium sites is still possible, but mediated through the $p$-orbitals of oxygen ions. 
These two step hopping processes are called super exchange and give rise to an anti-ferromagnetic coupling.
We will just sketch how to calculate the main contribution to an effective Ir-Ir hopping.

We pick a subsystem of two $J_{\mathrm{eff}}=\frac12$ orbitals of Ir at lattice sites $i$ and $j$ 
and take only hopping between neighbouring orbitals into account.
From the oxygen ion in between we find a double occupied $p$-orbital in between and denote the hopping parameter $t_p$. 
A scheme can be seen in figure \ref{superexchange}.

 \label{superexchange}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
%
%
The since this involves two hopping processes to and from the $p$-orbital, we get a factor of $t_p$ each time.
We have to divide by the energy of the intermediate step, which is $U+(E_d-E_p)$.
The effective hopping is then $t=\frac{t_p^2}{U+E_d-E_p}$.

%The diagonal term is still given by the eigenvalues of the atomic Hamiltonian with a shift due to the presence of the other potentials. 
%Since this term is proportional to unity, we can remove this factor from the Hamiltonian by shifting the energy scale.

\subsection{Second Quantization}

Having defined our single particle Hamiltonian in terms of orthonormal wave orbitals, 
we can construct the many particle wave function in terms of creation and annihilation operators. 
The operator $c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}$ creates a particle with spin $\sigma$ in the orbital $\ket{\varphi_i}$,
while its hermitian conjugate $c_{i,\dagger}$ removes it.
The particles have an effective spin of $\frac12$ and are therefore fermions. 
We introduce the anti-commutation rules for the creation and annihilation operators at equal times.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rClrCl}
 \Big\{c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}\:,\: c_{j,\sigma^{\prime}} \Big\} &=& \delta_{ij} \delta_{\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}} 
 &\qquad
 \Big\{c_{i,\sigma}\:,\: c_{j,\sigma^{\prime}} \Big\} &=& 0 \nonumber \\
 \Big\{c_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger}\:,\: c^{\dagger}_{j,\sigma^{\prime}} \Big\} &=& 0 &&& \label{acomm_rules}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
It follows immediately that  $-c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma} c^{\dagger}_{j,\sigma} = c^{\dagger}_{j,\sigma} c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}$ and $(c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma})^2 = 0$.
These relations ensure the antisymmetry of the total wave function and thereby the Pauli principle.


% looks like the same thing, but results in oscillations  at the overlapping tails, providing ON.
% Overlap integrals are transformed with that, providing then t_ij
% provides U_ijkl as well?
% see Altmann pp. 177 and 222

%Furthermore they are localized around the positions $\vec{R}_i$.
%Instead of the eigenfunctions of the single particle Hamiltonian, we can use linear combinations of them. 
%This gives us a different set of Wannier functions, that are related to the ones previously defined by another unitary transformation.
%The additional degrees of freedom can be used to optimize the Wannier functions according to certain criteria.
%The most common ones are maximal localization or symmetries of the crystal or the atomic orbitals.
% By taking a relevant subset of atomic states, and defining for each $\vec{k}$
%\begin{equation}
% H_{nm} = \bra{\Psi_{n,\vec{k}}} H \ket{\Psi_{m,\vec{k}}} \text{  and  } S_{nm} = \braket{\Psi_{n,\vec{k}}}{\Psi_{m,\vec{k}}}
%\end{equation}
%we can set up the secular equation
%\begin{equation}
% \det(H_{nm}-E_kS_{nm})=0.
%\end{equation}
%This gives us the band energies. The corresponding eigenstates are called Löwedin functions.
% BAD writing here, tsss. What is the poinit anyway?
% resemble the Löwedin states the crystal symmetry? They should (--> see Slater et al.)



%In this picture we think of electrons as being in a certain state of an atom and hopping to other states rather then being delocalized over the whole crystal.
%In any real system the states will have some overlap, creating the possibility for electrons to hop between different sites.

Creation and annihilation operators can be translated to momentum space as well.
The corresponding operators represent the creation and annihilation operators of the Wannier states. 
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  c^{\dagger}_{i , \sigma}  =  \frac1{\sqrt N}\sum_{\vec{k}} \euler^{\im \vec{k}\vec{R}_i } c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k} , \sigma}, 
      &\quad&
  c_{i , \sigma}  =  \frac1{\sqrt N} \sum_{\vec{k}} \euler^{-\im \vec{k}\vec{R}_i } c_{\vec{k} , \sigma},  \nonumber\\  
  c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k} , \sigma}  =  \frac1{\sqrt N} \sum_{i} \euler^{-\im \vec{k}\vec{R}_i } c^{\dagger}_{i , \sigma},
    &\quad&
  c_{\vec{k} , \sigma}  =  \frac1{\sqrt N}\sum_{i} \euler^{\im \vec{k}\vec{R}_i } c_{i , \sigma}. \label{FTc}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
They fulfil the same anti-commutation rules than in the operators in real space.

The single particle Hamiltonian, from now on denoted by $\hat H_0$, reads in second quantization
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \hat H_0 
    &=& \sum_{\sigma} \sum_{ij} -t_{ij} \, c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma} c_{j,\sigma},
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
where $t_{ij}$ are the off-diagonal matrix elements $\bra{\varphi_i} \hat H \ket{\varphi_j}$ defined above.

%
In cases where the tight binding approximation is valid, 
these hopping terms might be very small for large distances between site $i$ and $j$.
As a simplification we restrict the model to close neighbours only, setting all other elements of $\mathbf t$ to zero.
More precisely, we will restrict ourselves to first, second and third nearest neighbours only. 
Due to translational invariance, $t_{ij}$ depends only on the difference $\vec R_i - \vec R_j$.
We further assume isotropy between neighbours in different directions but with the same distance.
Then,  $t_{ij}$ depends only on three parameters,
\begin{equation}
 t_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l@{\quad}l@{\quad}l}
 t  			& \text{for }\langle i,j\rangle, 					&\text{nearest neighbours} \\ 
 t^{\prime}  		&\text{for } \langle \langle i,j \rangle \rangle, 			&\text{next nearest neighbours} \\
 t^{\prime \prime} 	&\text{for } \langle \langle \langle i , j \rangle \rangle \rangle, 	&\text{ next to next nearest neighbours} 
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
and can be expressed as a summation over neighbouring pairs only. 
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \hat{H}_0 &=& 
 - t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle,\sigma} \left( c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}c_{j,\sigma} + c^{\dagger}_{j,\sigma}c_{i,\sigma} \right)
 - t^{\prime} \sum_{\langle \langle i,j \rangle \rangle ,\sigma} \left( c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}c_{j,\sigma} +c^{\dagger}_{j,\sigma}c_{i,\sigma} \right) \nonumber \\ &&
 - t^{\prime \prime} \sum_{\langle \langle \langle i,j \rangle \rangle \rangle ,\sigma} \left( c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}c_{j,\sigma}   + c^{\dagger}_{j,\sigma}c_{i,\sigma} \right)
 -\mu \sum_{i,\sigma} c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}c_{i;\sigma}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The sums are restricted such, that they count each pair $i,j$ only once. 




\subsection{Band Structure In Momentum Space} \label{chapter_bandstructure}




In the simple-most version only nearest neighbour hopping is taken into account, setting $t^{\prime}$ and $t^{\prime \prime}$ to zero.
\begin{equation}
 \hat{H}_0 = - t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle,\sigma} \left (c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}c_{j,\sigma} + c^{\dagger}_{j,\sigma}c_{i,\sigma} \right) 	    -\mu \sum_{i,\sigma} c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}c_{i;\sigma}
\end{equation}
In the second term we introduced the chemical potential.
It shows the energetic cost to add a particle to the system.
As an external parameter it can be used to control the particle density $n$, that is the number of particles per site.
$n$ ranges from 0 to 2, since we can occupy each state with at max two particles with opposite spin. 
% \mu = \frac{U}{2} is explained later, when dealing with half filling in greater detail

In order to represent the Hamiltonian in momentum space we insert the relation between the representation of creation and annihilation operators in real space and momentum space,
as stated in equation \ref{FTc}.
%
First, we have a look at the chemical potential term. 
Because of the completeness relation \mbox{$\sum_i \euler^{(\vec{k}-\vec{l})\vec{R}_i } = N\delta_{\vec{k}\vec{l}}$}, it is diagonal in $k$-space as well.
\begin{equation}
 -\mu \sum_{i,\sigma} c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma}c_{i;\sigma} = 	-\mu \sum_{\vec{k},\sigma} c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\sigma}c_{\vec{k}\sigma}
\end{equation}
%
In a similar manner the hopping term turns into	
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{c}
 -\frac{t}{N} \sum_{\vec k \vec l ,\sigma} \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle } 
	      \left( 
	      \euler^{-\im \left(  \vec{k}\vec{R}_i - \vec{l}\vec{R}_j\right)} c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\sigma} c_{\vec l, \sigma}  
	      + \euler^{-\im \left(  \vec{k}\vec{R}_j - \vec{l}\vec{R}_i \right)} c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\sigma} c_{\vec l, \sigma} 
	      \right)	      
	      \label{ham_pspace}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
We can now re-parametrize the sum over nearest neighbours, using the translation vectors $\vec{T}_d$ between nearest neighbours.
$d$ is an index, that runs over all nearest neighbours. 
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} = \sum_i \sum_d \quad; \quad \vec{R}_j = \vec{R}_i + \vec{T}_d
\end{equation}

We can therefore write \ref{ham_pspace} as
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{Cl}
 & -\frac{t}{N} \sum_{\vec{k},\vec{l},\sigma} \sum_{i} \euler^{-\im \left(\vec{k}-\vec{l} \right)\vec{R}_i } 
    \sum_d \left(\euler^{-\im \vec{k}\vec{T}_d} + \euler^{\im  \vec{l} \vec{T}_d} \right) 
    c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\sigma}c_{\vec{l},\sigma} \nonumber \\
    =& \sum_{\vec{k},\sigma}  c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\sigma}c_{\vec{k},\sigma}  \underbrace{\sum_d -2t \cos( \vec{k} \vec{T}_d ) }_{\varepsilon_{\vec k} }
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
which shows that the single-particle Hamiltonian  is  diagonal in momentum space with the Wannier functions as eigenstates 
and momentum dependent eigenvalues $\varepsilon_{\vec k}$.

In the case of a two dimensional square lattice, the translational vectors of nearest neighbours are given by the lattice constant $a$ times the unit vectors in 
$x$- and $y$-direction, $T_d = a\cdot \vec{e}_d$, $ d \in \{x,y\}$, shown as green arrows in figure \ref{2d_square}.
Using $a$ as the basic length unit, that is $a=1$, 
and normalizing therefore the momentum to the interval $[-\pi,\pi]\times [-\pi,\pi]$ 
we get in this case
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{\vec k} = -2t\cos(k_x)-2t\cos(k_y). 
\end{equation}

\end{center}
\caption{translation vectors $\vec T_d$ in a two dimensional square lattice with first (green), second (blue) and third (red) neighbour interactions}
\label{2d_square}
\end{figure}

The additional term one gets for non-zero second and third neighbour interactions can be treated the same way. 
One has to include the corresponding translational vectors $\vec T_d$ with their respective couplings.
Figure \ref{2d_square} shows the vectors up to third neighbour interactions in the 2D square lattice.
The third neighbours have the same type of translational vectors as the first neighbours, just with twice the length.
The second neighbours are found at $\vec e_x \pm \vec e_y$.
The resulting expression for the energy dispersion in this situation reads
\begin{equation}
 \varepsilon_{\vec k } = -2t \left(\cos k_x + \cos k_y \right) -4t^{\prime} \cos k_x \cos k_y  -2t^{\prime \prime} \left( \cos 2k_x + \cos 2k_y \right)
\end{equation}

We note that the hopping term represents the kinetic energy of particles moving between different sites. 
It is the hopping parameter and the 
geometry of the lattice, that provide the energy dispersion. 
The energy dispersion for Sr$_2$IrO$_4$  with and without next-to-nearest neighbour interactions are shown in figure \ref{fig:energie_dispersion}.

\end{figure}




\subsection{Hubbard Interaction}

So far we did not take any interactions between particles into account.
The general form of a two particle operator is
\begin{equation}
 H_{\text{int}} = \sum_{\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_3 \sigma_4} \; \sum_{ijkl} U_{ijkl} \, c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma_1} c^{\dagger}_{j,\sigma_2} c_{k,\sigma_3} c_{l,\sigma_4}
\end{equation}
%
The matrix elements $U_{ijkl}$ are independent of spin and given by
\begin{equation}
 U_{ijkl} = \int \!  \dint^3 r  \, \dint^3 r^{\prime} \,  \varphi_i^*(\vec{r}) \varphi_j^*(\vec{r}^{\prime}) \frac{e^2}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime} |} \varphi_k(\vec{r}) \varphi_l(\vec{r}) 
\end{equation}
Due to the small overlap of different states $\varphi_i$, only a few matrix elements are of relevant magnitude.
The diagonal matrix elements $U_{iii} = U$ account for the repulsion between electrons on the same site and are certainly the most important contribution.
The fermionic operators ensure the Pauli principle. 
The only non-zero term proportional to $U_{iiii}$ is therefore $c^{\dagger}_{i,\uparrow} c^{\dagger}_{i,\downarrow} c_{i,\uparrow} c_{i,\downarrow}$. 
Using the number operator $n_{i,\sigma} = c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma} c_{i,\sigma}$, the diagonal interaction term reads
\begin{equation}
 H_{\text{int}} = U \sum_i n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow}.
\end{equation}
Other terms count the interaction of density fluctuations at neighbouring sites through $U_{ijij}$ 
or
the exchange coupling $U_{ijji}$, which yields a Heisenberg like coupling $J_{ij}$.

In the Hubbard model however we take only the diagonal terms $U_{iiii}$ into account.
We choose therefore $U_{ijkl} = \delta_{ijkl} U$. 
Reducing an interaction that is not necessarily local to only on-site interactions is a grave simplification, 
neglecting the vast amount of parameters in the interaction matrix $U_{ijkl}$ and therefore long range repulsion and exchange effects.
As a result, the optimal value for $U$, the only parameter left, does not any longer depend on the integral given above in a simple way.
The interaction seems to be drastically lowered due to screening effects compared to the value one would expect from the correlation integral of the corresponding orbitals
\cite{J.Phys.Cond.Matter.Vol21.34}.
It is not possible to link the parameter $U$ to a physical quantity directly
and the Hubbard model is therefore not a first principle model. 
$U$ has to be seen as an effective parameter.



% Mott Insulator (band split-up using U)
% How U changes the picture


%The Hubbard model is defined by the Hamiltonian
%\begin{equation}
% \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0
%	   + U \sum_i c^{\dagger}_{i,\uparrow}c_{i,\uparrow} c^{\dagger}_{i,\downarrow}c_{i,\downarrow} 
%	    . \label{Hubbard_space}
%\end{equation}
%with a band structure single particle Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_0$.

\subsubsection{Hubbard Term In Momentum Space}

We can express the interaction term through creation and annihilation operators in momentum space as well. 
The summation over all sites in the transformation yields an overall $\delta$-function of momenta,
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rl}
 &\frac{U}{N^2} \sum_{\vec{k}\vec{l}\vec{m}\vec{n}} \sum_i \euler^{-\im (\vec{k}-\vec{l}+\vec{m}-\vec{n})\vec{R}_i } 
    c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\uparrow}c_{\vec{l},\uparrow} c^{\dagger}_{\vec{m},\downarrow}c_{\vec{n},\downarrow} \nonumber \\
    =& \frac{U}{N} \sum_{\vec{k}\vec{l}\vec{m}\vec{n}} \delta(\vec{k}-\vec{l}+\vec{m}-\vec{n} )
	c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\uparrow}c_{\vec{l},\uparrow} c^{\dagger}_{\vec{m},\downarrow}c_{\vec{n},\downarrow} \nonumber \\
    =& \frac{U}{N} \sum_{\vec{k}\vec{k}^{\prime}\vec{q}}
	c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\uparrow}c_{\vec{k}-\vec{q},\uparrow} c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k}^{\prime},\downarrow}c_{\vec{k}^{\prime}+\vec{q},\downarrow} \:.
 \end{IEEEeqnarray}
In the last line we choose a convenient parametrization of momenta. 
The interaction is non-diagonal, but it ensures momentum conversation at each vertex.

The total expression for the Hamiltonian in momentum space reads
 \begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \sum_{\vec{k},\sigma} \left(\varepsilon_{\vec k} - \mu\right) c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\sigma}c_{\vec{k}\sigma} + \frac{U}{N} \sum_{\vec{k}\vec{k}^{\prime}\vec{q}}
	c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k},\uparrow}c_{\vec{k}-\vec{q},\uparrow} c^{\dagger}_{\vec{k}^{\prime},\downarrow}c_{\vec{k}^{\prime}+\vec{q},\downarrow}
 \end{equation} 









\section{Mean Field Equations}

\subsubsection{The Mean Field Hamiltonian}

We treat the Hubbard model in a perturbative approach at the mean field level.
The Hubbard term  $H_U$ represents the perturbation.
The two-particle operator can be read as a product of two single particle operators.
We can rewrite any product of two operators $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ as
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \hat{A}\cdot\hat{B} 
		    &=&	 \left(\hat A - \langle \hat A \rangle \right) \left( \hat B -\langle \hat B \rangle \right)
			 +\langle \hat A \rangle \hat B
			 +\langle \hat B \rangle \hat A
			 - \langle \hat A \rangle \langle \hat B \rangle
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
In the mean field approach we neglect the first term on the right hand side –the product of fluctuations around their expectation value– leaving us with
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A}\cdot\hat{B} 
		   \approx 
			 \langle \hat A \rangle \hat B
			 +\langle \hat B \rangle \hat A 
			 - \langle \hat A \rangle \langle \hat B \rangle
\end{equation}
% RPA has nothing to do with this I think…
%
We use this relation on the single particle operators 
$c^{\dagger}_{\vec k,\uparrow}c_{\vec k - \vec q,\uparrow}$
and 
$c^{\dagger}_{\vec k,\downarrow}c_{\vec k + \vec q,\downarrow}$
in the Hubbard term of the Hamiltonian. 
Furthermore, we drop the constant term corresponding to $\langle \hat A \rangle \langle \hat B \rangle$, since a constant in the Hamiltonian will not have any
influence on the dynamic of the system. 
The mean field approximation of the Hubbard term reads
\begin{equation}
 H_U \stackrel{\mathrm{mf}}{\approx}  \frac{U}{N}
 \sum_{\vec{q}} \sum_{\sigma} 
 \left( \sum_{\vec{p}^{\prime}} \langle c^{\dagger}_{\vec{p}^{\prime},-\sigma} c_{\vec{p}^{\prime}+\vec{q},-\sigma} \rangle \right)
	\sum_{\vec p}  c^{\dagger}_{\vec{p},\sigma} c_{\vec{p}-\vec{q},\sigma}. \label{Hubbard_mean_field}
\end{equation}
The expectation value for the one particle operator is different from zero for only two values of $\vec q$.
First, for $\vec q = 0$ the expression yields the spin dependent filling factor, i.e. the number of particles with spin $\sigma$ in relation to the total number of sites $N$.
\begin{equation}
 n_{\sigma} = \frac1N \sum_{\vec k} \langle c^{\dagger}_{\vec k, \sigma} c_{\vec k, \sigma} \rangle.
\end{equation}
A single  site can be empty or occupied by one particle, since we have spin-$\frac12$ particles. The possible values for $n_{\sigma}$ are therefore restricted to the range $[0,1]$.
The total number density is simply the sum of both spin dependent number densities, $n=n_{\uparrow}+n_{\downarrow}$ 
and ranges from the empty case $n=0$ to 2, corresponding to a situation where each sites is occupied by two particles with opposite spin.

%
%
The second contribution comes from $\vec q = (\frac12, \frac12)$.
This vector acts as a nesting vector for the Fermi surface of the band structure. 
The dispersion of a square lattice with only nearest-neighbour interactions 
 %can be divided into two sublattices $A$ and $B$, 
 %such that hopping occurs only from one sublattice to the other.
%and as a

and is therefore perfectly nested.
That means
$\varepsilon_{\vec k} = -\varepsilon_{\vec k + \vec Q}$ with the nesting vector $\vec Q = (\frac12,\frac12)$ in units of $2\pi$.
The Fermi surface at half filling is in this case a perfect square.
Introducing higher order hopping terms deforms the Fermi surface, but nesting with $\vec Q$ holds on a approximate level for small $t^{\prime}$ and $t^{\prime \prime}$.
The Fermi surfaces together with the nesting vector $\vec Q$ are shown for both cases in \ref{fig:energie_dispersion}.
%
%
%
%$\vec Q$ is the basis vector for antiferromagnetic ordering. 
%This is observed in these materials \todo{how general, which ones} and expected % for what reason?


Nesting with $\vec Q = (\frac 12, \frac12)$ leads to a non-zero expectation value for $\langle c^{\dagger}_{\vec k, \sigma} c_{\vec k + \vec Q ,\sigma}$
and therefore to a symmetry broken ground state with an anti-ferromagnetic moment. 
The staggered magnetization is the order parameter of an anti-ferromagnetic state.
In momentum space it reads
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{lCl}
 m_{s} &=& m_{s, \uparrow} - m_{s, \downarrow}, \\
 m_{s, \sigma} &=& \frac1N  \sum_i (-1)^i \langle c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma} c_{i,\sigma} \nonumber \\ &&
 \frac1N \sum_{\vec k} \langle c^{\dagger}_{\vec k , \sigma} c_{\vec k + \vec Q, \sigma} \rangle .
\end{IEEEeqnarray}


In terms of the above defined parameters equation \ref{Hubbard_mean_field} simplifies finally to
\begin{equation}
 \hat H = \sum_{\vec k, \sigma} \left( \varepsilon_{\vec k } - \mu + U n_{-\sigma} \right) c^{\dagger}_{\vec k, \sigma} c_{\vec k ,\sigma}
	  + U m_{s,-\sigma} \sum_{\vec k, \sigma} c^{\dagger}_{\vec k + \vec Q, \sigma} c_{\vec k, \sigma}.
\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
% H_U \approx \sum_{\sigma} \left( U n_{-\sigma} \sum_{\vec{p}} c^{\dagger}_{\vec{p}, \sigma} c_{\vec p, \sigma}

We are left with a Hamilton operator consisting only of single particle operators. 
That shows the idea of the mean field approach, describing non-interacting particles that are exposed to an averaged field.
This field is the result off the sum of all particles in the system. It's value will therefore be influenced by the particles itself.
As a result we have to solve the equations for the fields self-consistently, which will be done in the next section. 
The first term in the above mean field Hamiltonian represents the mean repulsion due to the equal charge of the electrons.
It is proportional to the number density of particles with opposite spin due to the on-site interaction, that is only possible for particles with opposite spin.
The second term corresponds to the coupling to a staggered magnetic field, that is a magnetic field with an alternating orientation on each site. 
The field strength is proportional to the magnetization of the ground state and given by $Um_s$.

\subsubsection{Mean Field Propagators}

The mean field Hamiltonian gives rise to two different propagators.
First we get the diagonal contribution, second an off-diagonal one from the staggered component. 
The propagators are defined by
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 G_{\vec k}(\tau) &=& -\langle \mathcal{T}_{\tau} c_{\vec k         ,\sigma}(\tau)  c^{\dagger}_{\vec k ,\sigma}(0) \rangle \\
 F_{\vec k}(\tau) &=& -\langle \mathcal{T}_{\tau} c_{\vec k +\vec{Q},\sigma}(\tau)  c^{\dagger}_{\vec k ,\sigma}(0) \rangle \\ \label{Def_Propagator}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
with the imaginary time ordering operator $\mathcal{T}_{\tau}$, acting on a pair of fermion operators according to
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \mathcal{T}_{\tau} \hat{A}(\tau_1) \hat{B}(\tau_2) &=&
 -\Theta(\tau_1-\tau_2)\hat{A}(\tau_1) \hat{B}(\tau_2) + \Theta(\tau_2-\tau_1)\hat{B}(\tau_2) \hat{A}(\tau_1) \nonumber \\
 &=& \left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\text{ for }}l} -\hat{A}(\tau_1) \hat{B}(\tau_2) & \tau_1 \ge \tau_2 \\ \hat{B}(\tau_2) \hat{A}(\tau_1) & \tau_1 < \tau_2 \end{array} \right.
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
%
From this definition follows that $n_\sigma$ and $m_{s,\sigma}$ can be expressed in terms of propagators, namely through
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{lCl}
 n_{\sigma} &=& \frac1N \sum_{\vec k} \left( 1-G_{\vec k, -\sigma}(0) \right) \label{n_DEF}\\
 m_{s,\sigma} &=& -\frac1N \sum_{\vec k} F_{\vec k, -\sigma}(0)		\label{m_DEF}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}


From the definition of the propagators in \ref{Def_Propagator} and the equation of motion for operators, 
$\frac{\dint}{\dint \tau} \hat{A} = [H,\hat{A}] + \frac{\partial}{\partial_{\tau}} \hat{A}$,
we get the differential equation
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \partial_{\tau} G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau) 
 &=&
 \delta(\tau) \langle c_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau) c^{\dagger}_{\vec k ,\sigma}(0) + c^{\dagger}_{\vec k ,\sigma}(0) c_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau) \rangle \nonumber \\&&
 + \Theta(\tau) \langle [\hat H , c_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau)] c^{\dagger}_{ \vec k ,\sigma}(0) \rangle		\nonumber \\ &&
 -  \Theta(-\tau) \langle c^{\dagger}_{ \vec k ,\sigma}(0) [\hat H , c_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau)]  \rangle \label{EOM_G}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
Here we used $\partial_{\tau} \Theta(\tau) = \delta(\tau)$.
The commutators can be evaluated using the identity $[AB,C] = A\{B,C\} - \{A,C\}B$ and the anti-commutation rules for the creation and annihilation operators in
equation \ref{acomm_rules}.
%
This leaves us with
\begin{equation}
 [H,c_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau)]=-\left(\varepsilon_{\vec k}-\mu + Un_{-\sigma} \right) c_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau) - Um_{s,-\sigma} c_{\vec k +\vec{Q},\sigma}(\tau)
\end{equation}
Putting this back in \ref{EOM_G} together with the definitions for $G$ and $F$, we get
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
  \partial_{\tau} G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau) 
&=&
\delta(\tau)\langle \{c_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau),c^{\dagger}_{\vec k ,\sigma}(0)\} \rangle
- \left( \varepsilon_{\vec k }-\mu+ Un_{-\sigma} \right) G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau)  \nonumber \\ &&
 -Um_{s,-\sigma} F_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau) \label{EOM_G_II}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
In a next step we take the Fourier transform of this equation. 
The Fourier transformed propagator is related to the propagator in imaginary time through
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau) &=& \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_n \euler^{-\im \omega_n \tau} G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n) \\
 G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n) &=& \int_0^{\beta} \! \!\dint  \tau \: \euler^{\im \omega_n \tau} G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau)
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The so called Matsubara frequencies $\omega_n$ are given by $\omega_n = \frac{\pi}{\beta}(2n+1), \; n \! \in \! \mathbb{Z}$.
This ensures the anti-periodicity of fermionic Green's functions, $G(\tau+\beta) = -G(\tau)$.
Transforming equation \ref{EOM_G_II} to momentum space we get
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \left( \im \omega_n -\varepsilon_{\vec k } +\mu - Un_{-\sigma} \right) G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n) = 1 +Um_{s,-\sigma} F_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n)
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
In the same way, starting from $\frac{\dint}{\dint \tau} F_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\tau)$ we get for the off-diagonal propagator
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \left( \im \omega_n -\varepsilon_{\vec k +\vec{Q}} +\mu - Un_{-\sigma} \right) F_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n) = Um_{s,-\sigma} G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n)
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
There is no constant term, since the anti-commutator in \ref{EOM_G_II} is zero for off-diagonal momenta. 
Putting the last two equations together we get the expressions for the propagators
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n) &=& \frac{ ( \im \omega_n - \varepsilon_{\vec k +\vec{Q}} + \mu -Un_{-\sigma} )}
			      { ( \im \omega_n - \varepsilon_{\vec k +\vec{Q}} + \mu -Un_{-\sigma} )
			        ( \im \omega_n - \varepsilon_{\vec k }         + \mu -Un_{-\sigma} )
			      - U^2m_{s,-\sigma}^2 } \nonumber \\
 F_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n) &=& \frac{ Um_{s,-\sigma}}
			    { ( \im \omega_n - \varepsilon_{\vec k +\vec{Q}} + \mu -Un_{-\sigma} )
			      ( \im \omega_n - \varepsilon_{\vec k }         + \mu -Un_{-\sigma} )
			      - U^2m_{s,-\sigma}^2 }			      
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
We can rewrite this in a more appealing way by factorizing the denominator of both propagators. 
The poles are located at
\begin{equation}
 E_{\vec k ,\sigma}^{\pm}
 =
 \frac{\varepsilon_{\vec k }+\varepsilon_{\vec k +\vec{Q}}}2 -\mu + Un_{-\sigma}  \pm \sqrt{ \left(\frac{\varepsilon_{\vec k }-\varepsilon_{\vec k +\vec{Q}}}2\right)^2 + U^2m_{s,-\sigma}^2 }
 \label{EpmDef}
\end{equation}
Note that $E_{\vec k ,\sigma}^{\pm}=E_{\vec k +\vec{Q},\sigma}^{\pm}$, since $\varepsilon_{\vec k +2\vec{Q}}=\varepsilon_{\vec k }$.
These energies correspond to the formation of two bands, defined over the reduced or magnetic Brillouin zone.
The band structure is shown in figure \ref{EpmDisp}. 
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{../EpEm_tttU44}
  \caption{$E^+_{\vec k}$ and $E^-_{\vec k}$ band for $U=4.4$ and $(t,t^{\prime},t^{\prime \prime})=(1.0,0.22,0.12)$.}
\label{EpmDisp}
  \end{center}
 \end{figure}
%
It be seen clearly, that the bands are well separated.
It is conclusive form their expression, that the bands are separated by approximately $Um_s$ for large enough $U$.
The split up is a result of the repulsive interaction and the symmetry breaking of the anti-ferromagnet ground state.
The split of the half filled $J=frac12$-band in one band below the Fermi surface and the other one above it makes Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ an insulator.
This only possible since, because the $t_{2g}$ states were already split into two smaller bands by the strong SOC. 
Sr$_2$RhO$_4$ is similar to Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ in structure and electron configuration,
just with the $4d$ orbitals, which are less extended and have therefore stronger electron-electron interactions,
but a lower SOC. 
Therefore it shows metallic behaviour in the ground state \cite{PhysRevLett.96.246402}. 


Using these expressions the propagators can be expressed in terms of the new bands,
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 G_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n) &=& \frac{ \im \omega_n - \varepsilon_{\vec k +\vec{Q}} +\mu -Un_{-\sigma} }
					    { (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec k ,\sigma}^+) (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec k ,\sigma}^-) },
\\
 F_{\vec k ,\sigma}(\im \omega_n) &=& \frac{ Um_{s,-\sigma} }
					    { (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec k ,\sigma}^+) (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec k ,\sigma}^-)}.
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
We note that $F_{\vec k,\sigma}$ is invariant under a translation $\vec k \rightarrow \vec k +\vec Q$, 
while $G_{\vec k,\sigma}$ changes depending on the dispersion $\varepsilon_{\vec k}$.


%\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
%  G_{\vec{p},\sigma}(\im \omega_n) &=& \frac{ u_{\vec{p}        ,\sigma }}{ (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^+) }
%			+ \frac{ u_{\vec{p}+\vec{Q},\sigma }}{ (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^-) } \\
%  F_{\vec{p},\sigma}(\im \omega_n) &=& \frac{ \tilde{u}_{\vec{p},\sigma }}{ (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^+) }
%			- \frac{ \tilde{u}_{\vec{p},\sigma }}{ (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^-) }
%\end{IEEEeqnarray}
%where $u$ and $\tilde{u}$ are given by
% \begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
% u_{\vec{p},\sigma} &=& \frac{E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^+ - \varepsilon_{\vec{p}+\vec{Q}} +\mu -Un_{-\sigma} }{E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^+ -E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^-} \\
% \tilde{u}_{\vec{p},\sigma} &=& \frac{Um_{s,-\sigma}}{E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^+ -E_{\vec{p},\sigma}^-}.
% \end{IEEEeqnarray}

% \todo{ How to draw nice diagrams in \LaTeX?}

There is an alternative approach from a diagrammatic point of view, that gives the same differential equation for the propagators.
Following the notation of \cite{PhysRevB.65.132404}, 
we denote the bare propagator $G^0_{\vec k,\sigma}$ by a single line, the mean field propagators by double lines and the interaction by a dashed line.
The off-diagonal propagator $F_{\vec k ,\sigma}$ is marked with an doubled arrow head.
The diagrams for a self-consistent mean field approximation are shown in figure \ref{Diagr_Props}.

By including only single loops we neglect again the possibility of quantum fluctuations, i.e. there are no interactions with virtual states.
Note that the particles on each site of the interaction have different spins and there is no spin transfer. 
All straight arrows have therefore the same spin, while the propagators forming the loops have the opposite spin.
We reflect the sum up to infinite such interactions by using the mean field propagator after the interaction. 
%
Self-consistency is achieved by using the mean field propagators in the loops.
This reflects the fact, that $m_{s,\sigma}$ and $n_{\sigma}$ itself depend on the sum over the respective mean field propagator.
As a result we have to solve the equations for $m_{s,\sigma}$ and $n_{\sigma}$ iteratively. % CHECK IF THIS SENTENCE APPEARS LATER AGAIN.

reproduces the above expressions for $G_{\vec k, \sigma}$ and $F_{\vec k ,\sigma}$.

\section{Observables}

In the chapters above we derived an effective Hamiltonian for the iridates.
Furthermore we introduced the Green's functions of the mean field approach. 
We can use this formalism now, to calculate observable quantities.
They can be compared to experiments to validate the calculations. 
The interaction parameter $U$ has to be fitted to experiments as well.



\subsubsection{X-Ray and Neutron Scattering Experiments}

The main experimental techniques that resolve the magnetic structure of such materials are inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering experiments.
Neutrons are uncharged and do therefore not  interact with the charges of atoms and electrons in the crystal.
This allows them to penetrate thick probes and to interact well below the surface, which makes measurements of the bulk possible. 
They interact solely through their intrinsic spin with the crystal, 
which makes them good candidates for probing the magnetic excitation spectrum.

During the last two decades, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) became an important alternative.
It uses high energetic photons, whose energy is tuned to be resonant to an atomic transition in the system.
The exited electron is lifted in the bands at the Fermi level, where they can interact with particles close to this band.
When the whole created by the incident photon is filled with some electron from that band, a secondary photon is sent out. 
The secondary photon might have a different energy and momentum due to the dynamics of particles in the relevant band,
which is the reason, that this process is inelastic.


In both cases, neutron and photon scattering,  we can measure the momentum transfer and energy transfer to the probe.
The differential cross section $\frac{\dint^2 \sigma}{\dint \Omega \dint \omega}$ is the distribution of secondary particles with a certain momenta. 
The difference to the momenta of the primary photon is passed to the probe as an excitation.
At basic excitations of the system scattering becomes resonant and the differential cross section has a pole.
The position $(\vec q, \omega)$ of these  poles reveal therefore the  dispersion of magnetic excitations in the material.

The differential cross section is proportional to the imaginary part of the retarded response function \cite[Chapter~7.3.1]{altland2010condensed},
which will be described in the next paragraph. 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\dint^2 \sigma}{\dint \Omega \dint \omega} = -2 \Im \left( \chi(\omega \vec q) \right)
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Response Functions}

Response functions describe the reaction of the system to an external distortion.
The distortion is some generalized external force $F$, for example an electromagnetic field.
This force might vary in space and time.
It needs to be coupled to the system through some sort of interaction, that is introduced into the Hamiltonian by a additional term 
$\hat H_F = \hat X(F)$ 
for some operator $\hat X$.
In the simplest case, $X$ is linear in $F$, that is $X = X^{\prime} F$.
A linear dependence provides a good description for week perturbations of the system, that is for $F\rightarrow 0$.
$X^{\prime}$ is then just the first term of an expansion of $X$. 
%
The effect on the system will then be measured by the change in some observable $y=\langle Y \rangle$,
which might coincide with the operator $X^{\prime}$.
%
The response of the system is then completely encoded in the linear response function $\chi$, which depends in $Y$ and $X^{\prime}$, 
but is  independent of the external force $F$.


The dynamic magnetic susceptibility is the linear response function to an external space and time dependent magnetic field $\vec B(\vec r,t)$.
It couples to the  magnetic moment $\vec M$ in the system through $  \int \dint^3 r \hat{\vec M}(\vec r) \vec B(\vec r,t)$.
The distortion is quantified through $ \vec M$ as well.
The magnetic susceptibility is therefore proportional to the expectation value of magnetic structure factor. 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{ab}(\vec q,\omega) = \int \dint \tau \euler^{\im \omega \tau} \langle  M^a(q,\tau) M^b(-\vec q, 0) \rangle 
\end{equation}
Measurements are often performed on a poly-crystals or powder. 
Therefore we don't have a fixed crystall orientation, but rather an average over all spatial orientations.
The effective susceptibility is therefore diagonal with the components
\begin{equation}
 \chi^{ab}_{\mathrm{eff}} = \delta^{ab} \mathrm{Tr}(\chi) = \delta^{ab} \langle \vec M(q,\tau) \vec M(-\vec q, 0) \rangle \label{magnSuscI}
\end{equation}



In the simplest case, the spin axes are parallel to the symmetry axes of the crystal.
$\vec M$ is then proportional to the spin $\vec J$. 
The spin operator is a one-particle operator with the components $a=x,y,z$, defined as
\begin{equation}
 J^a(R_i)= J^a_i = \frac12\sum_{\sigma,\sigma^{\prime}} c^{\dagger}_{i,\sigma} \left(\sigma^a \right)_{\sigma\sigma^{\prime}} c_{i,\sigma},
\end{equation}
$\sigma^a$ are the Pauli matrices.
%
The momentum space  representation is
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
J^{a}(\vec q) &=& \frac12\sum_{i} \sum_{\sigma,\sigma^{\prime}}  \euler^{\im \vec q \vec R_i} c^{\dagger}_{i ,\sigma} \left(\sigma^a \right)_{\sigma\sigma^{\prime}} c_{i} \nonumber \\
&=& \frac12\sum_{\vec k} \sum_{\sigma,\sigma^{\prime}} c^{\dagger}_{\vec k, \sigma} \left(\sigma^a \right)_{\sigma\sigma^{\prime}} c_{\vec k + \vec q,\sigma^{\prime}}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
%

In Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ it is the field of the ligands, that define the spin axes. 
The octahedra are rotated by $\pm \Theta$ in the $x$-$y$-plane in a staggered pattern.
It is therefore necessary, to project the spin components on the axes of the lattice at each site.
The relation between the magnetic moment, expressed in the axis of thelattice, and the spin $\vec J_i$  at site $i$ is therefore 
related by a space dependent coordinate transformation.
The transformation matrix  at site $i$ is
\begin{equation}
 \vec M_i = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} \cos(\Theta) & -(-1)^i \sin(\Theta) & 0 \\ (-1)^i \sin(\Theta) & \cos(\Theta) & 0 \\ 0&0&1 \end{array} \right) \vec J_i
\end{equation}
This transformation can lead to a small ferromagnetic moment in an antiferromagnetic ground state.
If we describe the antiferromagnetic ordering with respect to the $x$-axis of the spins,
then we get a net magnetization in $y$-direction, since the alternating sign in the transformation matrix cancels the spin flip in 
the antiferromagnetic ordering.

\caption{The staggered rotation of antiferromagnetic spins lead to a net ferromagnetic moment (red)}
\label{mFerr}
\end{figure}

The ferromagnetic moment is proportional to the antiferromagnetic ordering times the projected component,
\begin{equation}
 m = \sin \Theta m_s.
\end{equation}



The alternating sign $(-1)^i$ in the rotations express the staggered pattern and
can be expressed through the wave vector of antiferromagnetic ordering $\vec Q$, 
which reads $(-1)^i = \euler^{\im \vec Q \vec R_i}$.
In momentum space, the relation between magnetic moment and spin is therefore
\begin{equation}
 \left( \begin{array}{c} M^x_{\vec q} \\ M^y_{\vec q} \\ M^z_{\vec q} \end{array} \right) = 
-2\mu_b \left( \begin{array}{c} \cos(\Theta) J^x_{\vec q} -\sin(\Theta) J^y_{\vec q + \vec Q} \\ \cos(\Theta) J^y_{\vec q} +\sin(\Theta) J^x_{\vec q + \vec Q} \\ J^z_{\vec q} \end{array} \right) 
\end{equation}






We can replace $\vec M$ in equation \ref{magnSuscI} and get
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \chi_{\mathrm{eff}}(\omega,\vec q) &=& \cos^2{\Theta} \left( \chi_J^{xx}(\omega,\vec q)+ \chi_J^{yy}(\omega,\vec q) \right) \nonumber \\ &&
 + \sin^2\Theta \left(\chi_J^{xx} (\omega, \vec q + \vec Q) + \chi_J^{yy}(\omega,\vec p + \vec Q)\right)
 + \chi_J^{zz}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
Where we introduced the spin susceptibility $\chi_J^{ab}(\tau,\vec q = \langle J^a(\tau,\vec q) J^b(0,\vec q) \rangle$. 
Based on the transformation of Pauli matrices $\sigma^{\pm} = \sigma^x \pm \im \sigma^y$ we get the spin components $J^{\pm}$, 
which fulfil the relation $J^{\pm} = (J^{\mp})^{\dagger}$.
Using this relation we can express the sum of $xx$ and $yy$ components of the spin susceptibility in terms of $+-$ and $-+$ components,
\begin{equation}
 \chi_J^{xx} + \chi_J^{yy} = \chi_J^{+-} + \chi_J^{-+} = 2\chi_J^{+-}
\end{equation}
The magnetic susceptibility gets therefore the form
\begin{equation}
 \chi_{\mathrm{eff}}(\omega, \vec q) = 2\cos^2\Theta \chi_J^{+-}(\omega,\vec q)  + 2\sin^2\Theta\chi_J^{+-}(\omega,\vec q+ \vec Q) + \chi_J^{zz}(\omega, \vec q)
\end{equation}



  










\subsection{Dynamic Magnetic Susceptibility In The Green's Function Formalism}


We can expand the spin susceptibility in terms of Green's functions. 
We will first calculate the transverse susceptibility $\chi_J^{+-}$, by summing up the relevant diagrams.
The longitudinal component $\chi_J^{zz}$ is then calculated in a similar manner.


%The components of the magnetic susceptibility are defined by
%\begin{equation}
% \chi^{ab}(\tau - \tau^{\prime}) = \sum_{\vec{p}} \left( \sum_{\alpha, \beta} c^{\dagger}_{\vec k, \alpha }(\tau) \left(\sigma^{a}\right)_{\alpha \beta} c_{\vec k , \beta}(\tau)  \right)
%			    \cdot \left(  \sum_{\gamma, \delta} c^{\dagger}_{\vec k, \gamma }(\tau^{\prime}) \left(\sigma^{b}\right)_{\gamma \delta} c_{\vec k , \delta}(\tau^{\prime}) \right)  
%\end{equation}


Expressing $\chi_J^{+-}$ and $\chi_J^{-+}$ in creation and destruction operators gives
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \chi^{+-}(\vec q,\omega) &=& \int_0^{\beta} \!\!\dint \tau \euler^{\im \omega \tau} \langle \mathcal{T}_{\tau} S^+(\vec q,\tau) S^-(-\vec q,0) \rangle \nonumber \\
			  &=&\int_0^{\beta} \!\!\dint \tau \euler^{\im \omega \tau} 
			  \sum_{\vec k \vec k^{\prime}} \langle c^{\dagger}_{\vec k,\downarrow}(\tau) c_{\vec k+\vec q, \uparrow}(\tau) 
								    c^{\dagger}_{\vec k^{\prime}+\vec q,\downarrow}(0) c_{\vec k^{\prime},\uparrow}(0) \rangle.
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
As a four point correlation function, it describes the propagation of a particle-hole pair with momentum $\vec q$.
We restrict the sum over all diagrams to the most relevant subclass.
It is given by diagrams, which form a chain of bubbles or a ladder of particle-hole pairs.
This approximation is known as the random phase approximation (RPA). 
Since the particle and hole propagator of such basic excitations are always connected at the same vertices, their product is independent of the phase. 
This would not be the case if interactions with quantum fluctuations were taken into account. 
The situation corresponds to a phase that  is randomly distributed and cancels therefore in the 
thermodynamic limit. 
Those are furthermore the diagrams, where each occurrence of $\frac UN$ is paired with a sum over momenta, which runs over all $N$ momenta.
Diagrams beyond the RPA have fewer integrations over free momenta and are therefore suppressed in the large N limit.
The first order bubble diagrams of the RPA expansion are shown in figure \ref{1orderLadder}.

\caption{building blocks of ladder diagrams for $\chi^{+-}(\vec q, \im \omega_n)$}
\label{blocks}
\end{table}
%
Momentum conversation at each vertex limits the sum over momenta in each block to $\vec k^{\prime} = \vec k + \vec q$ or $\vec k^{\prime} = \vec k + \vec q + \vec Q$
The second possibility is due to the off-diagonal propagator $F_{\vec k,\sigma}$, that adds $\vec Q$ to the momentum. 
Each block consists of a sum over the Brillouin zone, we can therefore shift the momentum in the product of propagators without changing the value of the sum.
As mentioned above, only $G_{\vec k,\sigma}$ changes under a shift of $\vec Q$, $F_{\vec k,\sigma}$ however is invariant under such a transformation.
Therefore only $x$ will change it's value for $\vec q \rightarrow \vec q + \vec Q$, in all other situations the sum is unchanged, 
as the transformation can be absorbed in $F_{\vec k,\sigma}$,
We will write $\bar x$ to denote the expression for $x$ with $\vec k - \vec k^{\prime} = \vec q + \vec Q$.
When combining the building blocks of the ladder we have to keep track of the momentum difference $\vec k - \vec k^{\prime}$ in the sum over paired propagators.
In order to deal with the right momenta between upper and lower propagator we rewrite it as a $ 2 \times 2$ matrix equation and pick the value that 
corresponds to having $\vec q$ as the external momentum on both sides of the diagram.
The upper component in this matrix equation corresponds to $\vec k - \vec k^{\prime} = \vec q$, 
while the lower one corresponds to $\vec k -\vec k^{\prime} = \vec q + \vec Q$.
The full equation reads then
\begin{equation}
 \chi_{J}^{+-}(\vec q,\im \omega_n) = 
 \left( \begin{array}{cc} x+y & z_1+z_2 \end{array} \right) \cdot \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} (-\lambda \mathbf M)^m \cdot \left( \begin{array}{c} -1 \\  \: 0 \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
with the matrix $\mathbf M$ combining all the possibilities for one new step in the ladder for each order $m$,
\begin{equation}\label{M_def}
\mathbf M =  \left( \begin{array}{cc} x+y & z_1+z_2 \\
			       z_1+ z_2 & \bar x +  y  \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
At the end of a ladder diagram however we have to fulfil $\vec k - \vec k^{\prime} = \vec q$. 
The last vector ensures the right external momentum at the end and takes care of the minus sign, arising from the loop.
The infinite sum of bubble diagrams represents a geometric series and has an analytical expression.
Using the expression for geometric sums for matrices we can express the infinite sum through
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{l}
 \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} (-\lambda \mathbf M)^m = \left( \mathbf{1} + \lambda \mathbf M \right)^{-1}  
 %\\ = \left[ \left(1+\lambda(x+y)\right)\left(1+\lambda(\bar x + \bar y)\right) - (z_1 +z_2)(\bar z_1 + \bar z_2) \right]^{-1} \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1+\lambda(\bar x+\bar y) & -(\bar z_1 + \bar z_2) \\ -(z_1 + z_2) & 1+\lambda(x+y) \end{array} \right) \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The whole expression reads then
\begin{equation}
 \chi_{\mathrm{RPA}}^{+-}(\vec q,\im \omega_n) = 
 \frac{ -(x+y)\left(1+\lambda(\bar x+ y) \right) +\lambda(z_1 + z_2)^2}
 {\left(1+\lambda(x+y)\right)\left(1+\lambda(\bar x + y)\right) - \lambda^2(z_1 +z_2)^2} \label{ladder_sum}
\end{equation}
In order to deal with the infinite Matsubara frequency summation we use the procedure from Appendix \ref{MFS},
as we did for finding $m_s$.
The remaining expression depends then only on $\im \omega_n$.
We are interested in the dependence on real frequencies $\omega$. 
Expression \ref{ladder_sum} possesses poles on the real axis, making a simple replacement of $\im \omega_ n$ with $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$ impossible. 
We perform the analytical continuation $\im \omega_n \rightarrow \omega + \im \eta$ with $\omega, \eta \in \mathbb{R}$ and for a small $\eta >0$.
By choosing $\eta$ to be positive we get the retarded response function. \todo{elaborate on that?}
The expression can then be evaluated by carrying out the sum over the momenta using a small numerical value for $\eta$.
This allows us not only to calculate the imaginary part, a finite value of $\eta$ smoothes the resulting response function.
In general, for a function of the type $(\omega+\im \eta - E)^{-1}$, the imaginary part is 
$\frac{- \eta}{\eta^2 + (\omega-E)^2} \stackrel{\eta \rightarrow 0}{\longrightarrow} \pi \delta(\omega -E)$.
In the actual limit of vanishing $\eta$ we expect a delta function, whose poles might not match the discretized momenta of the grid exactly.
Broadening the delta function ensures to not miss momenta due to a finite sized grid and yields a result closer to actual measurements, 
where the response function also shows a finite line width. 

The position of the poles finally yields the spin-wave dispersion $\omega(\vec q)$.
Furthermore, we expect a continuum at higher energies. 

\subsubsection{Longitudinal Magnetic Susceptibility}

The longitudinal spin susceptibility consists of particle-hole propagators with equal spin.
This doesn't allow for interactions between particle and hole, but for recombination and creation of a new pair. 
The diagrams to be summed are therefore chains of bubbles.

\caption{elements of the chain in $\chi_J^{zz}$}
\label{bubbles}
\end{table}
The bubbles in table \ref{bubbles} show the building blocks of the chains, that are summed up 
in the diagrammatic expansion of $\chi_J^{zz}$ in the random phase approximation. 
The second column shows the relation to the previously defined products of operators $x,y,z_1,z_2$.
Since only $F_{\vec k, \sigma}$ depends on the spin with the simple relation $F_{\vec k, -\sigma} = - F_{\vec k, \sigma}$,
the relation to the expressions found earlier is just a spin dependent sign.
Since the Hubbard interaction couples only spins with opposite orientation, two consecutive bubbles in the row must have opposite spin.
The last to blocks, proportional to $s_{\sigma}z_i$ change the momentum, that is transferred through the interaction by $\vec Q$. 
The difference of $\vec k$ and $\vec k^{\prime}$ between the upper and lower propagator in the bubble is therefore restricted to the external momentum $\vec q$ and 
a shifted momentum, $\vec q + \vec Q$.
In order to keep track of the alternating spins and the right transferred momentum, we set up a matrix as before. 
This time we have to deal with four components, that is spin and transferred vector. 
Let the components be $\left( (\vec q,\uparrow) , (\vec q+\vec Q,\uparrow) , (\vec q,\downarrow) , (\vec q+\vec Q,\downarrow) \right)^T$.
The sum over all possible chains can then be expressed as 
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \chi_J^{zz} &=& \langle \sum_{\vec k \vec k^{\prime}} 
 ( c^{\dagger}_{\vec k,\uparrow} c_{\vec k+\vec q,\uparrow} - c^{\dagger}_{\vec k,\downarrow} c_{\vec k+\vec q,\downarrow} )
 ( c^{\dagger}_{\vec k^{\prime},\uparrow} c_{\vec k^{\prime}+\vec q,\uparrow} - c^{\dagger}_{\vec k^{\prime},\downarrow} c_{\vec k^{\prime}+\vec q,\downarrow} ) \rangle
 \nonumber \\&=& 
   \left(\begin{array}{c}  x-y \\  z_1 -z_2 \\ y-x \\ z_1-z_2 \end{array} \right)^T  %\nonumber \\ &&  \quad \times 
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  (-\lambda)^n \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 &  \mathbf M_{\downarrow} \\ \mathbf M_{\uparrow} & 0 \end{array} \right)^n 
 \left( \begin{array}{c} 1\\0\\-1\\0 \end{array}  \right) \label{zzDef}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The last vector ensures again that we pick the bubbles with $\vec k-\vec k^{\prime} = \vec q$ at the end of the chain.
The matrix $\mathbf M_{\sigma}$ is defined similar to $\mathbf M$ of equation \ref{M_def}. 
It differs only by the sign changes of it entries,
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf M_{\sigma} = \left( \begin{array}{cc} x-y & s_{\sigma}(z_1-z_2) \\ s_{\sigma} (z_1-z_2) & \overline x - y \end{array} \right) 
\end{equation}
The geometric sum can be regrouped in terms of even and odd powers of $n$.
After taking out one power from the odd sum we can add the two sums again and multiply it with unity plus on times the original matrix,
\begin{multline}
 \sum_n \lambda^n \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 &  \mathbf M_{\downarrow} \\ \mathbf M_{\uparrow} & 0 \end{array} \right)^n  
 = 
\sum_n \lambda^{2n} \left( \begin{array}{cc}   \mathbf M_{\downarrow}\mathbf M_{\uparrow} & 0  \\ 0 & \mathbf M_{\uparrow}\mathbf M_{\downarrow}  \end{array} \right)^{2n} 
\left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & -\lambda \mathbf M_{\uparrow} \\ \lambda -\mathbf M_{\downarrow} & 1 \end{array} \right) \\
=

\left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & -\lambda \mathbf M_{\uparrow} \\ -\lambda \mathbf M_{\downarrow} & 1 \end{array} \right) 
 \end{multline}
Inserting the definition of $\mathbf M_{\sigma}$ in equation \ref{zzDef} and writing it out yields the closed form expression for
$\chi_J^{zz}$ in the random phase approximation,
\begin{multline}
 \chi_J^{zz} = 2 \Big( -(1-\lambda^2(\overline x-y)^2 + \lambda^2 (z_1-z_2)^2 ) (x-y) (1+\lambda(x-y)) \\
			+(1-\lambda^2( x-y)^2 + \lambda^2 (z_1-z_2)^2 ) \lambda (z_1-z_2) \\
	      + \lambda^2(x-\overline x)(z_1-z_2)^2 (1+2\lambda(x-y)) \Big) \\ 
			\times \left( \det(1-\mathbf M_{\uparrow} \mathbf M_{\downarrow} ) \right)^{-1}
\end{multline}
with the denominator
\begin{multline}
 \det(1-\mathbf M_{\uparrow} \mathbf M_{\downarrow} ) = \left((1-\lambda^2(x-y)^2 + \lambda^2(z_1-z_2)^2 \right) \\
		  \cdot \left(1-\lambda^2(\overline x-y)^2 + \lambda^2(z_1-z_2)^2 \right) \\
							  +\lambda^4(z_1-z_2)^2(x-\overline x)^2 
\end{multline}


 The expressions for $\chi_J^{+-}$ and $\chi_J^{zz}$ are imaginary through the use of imaginary frequencies in $x,y,z_1$ and $z_2$.
 We want to evaluate the expressions for real frequencies, but we have to keep an infinitesimal imaginary part due to poles on the 
 real frequency axis. This leads to a vanishing imaginary part, except for a vanishing denominator, where it resembles a delta function. 
 In order to find the poles it is therefore sufficient to evaluate the denominator to 0.

\subsection{Corrections due to Quantum Fluctuations}
  
The simplifications we made in order to treat the Hubbard model in the mean field approach,  
eliminate any effects that are caused by quantum fluctuations.
These effects may be small and we are able to cover the main features of the system with our simplified description,
but their effect have to be taken into account, especially when comparing calculations to measurements, where they will always be present.
One example is the staggered magnetization, that is overestimated in the mean field treatment. 
Fluctuations around the antiferromagnetic ground state act as a distortion to the ordering and lower therefore the expectation value of $m_s$.


Calculating the full corrections is beyond the scope of this thesis, but we can account for some major corrections, that have no complicated dependencies.
For the Heisenberg model, the corrections to the spin-wave-velocity, denoted by $\mathcal{Z}_c$, are well known.
They are given by the higher order terms of the $\frac1S$ expansion. 
The main contribution is independent of momentum and frequency. 
Higher order terms are an order of magnitude smaller and their momentum dependence changes the correction factor by $2\%$ at max.
Usually one uses therefore a constant of $\mathcal{Z}_c=1.18$ value to renormalize the whole spin-wave dispersion \cite{PhysRevB.45.10131}.

We will see that our calculation scheme provides the result of the uncorrected linear spin-wave theory in the limit of large U. 
The fact that the Heisenberg model is the large-$U$ limit of the Hubbard model suggests using the same correction factor.
In reference \cite{PhysRevB.43.3617}, Singh calculated corrections in the Hubbard model, 
given by diagrams corresponding to quantum fluctuations,
and found a value consistent with $\mathcal{Z}_c$.

\section{Specifications} %of the Calculation}

For all calculations we use dimensionless quantities. 
Firstly, we set the lattice spacing to unity, $a=1$. 
The resulting momenta are therefore given by $(\frac{2\pi n}{N},\frac{2\pi m}{N})$ for $n,m \in [-\frac N2, \frac N2)$.
Furthermore, we express all energy in units of $t$, reducing the number of free parameters in the Hamiltonian therfore by one.
It depends now on only on the parameters $\nicefrac Ut$, $\nicefrac {\mu}t$ and eventually $\nicefrac{t^{\prime}}t$ and $\nicefrac{t^{\prime \prime}}t$.
Temperatures are scaled accordingly with $k_b=1$.
If not otherwise specified, we use only dimensionless units from now on and we will drop $\nicefrac{\cdot7}{t}$ and write just the corresponding symbol, 
assuming it is in units of $t$.


Since the Hubbard model reduces electron-electron interactions in a very crude manner by taking only on-site interactions into account,
its only free parameter $U$ is treated as an adjustable parameter, without an external reference value from other calculations or measurements.	
For this reason the Hubbard model cannot be seen as a first-principle method \cite{J.Phys.Cond.Matter.Vol21.34},
but rather an effective model, that extends a first principle method – the band structure – by introducing one adjustable parameter.
The value of $U$ in materials is not directly observable, but relates to physical quantities as for example the gap in the electrical excitation spectrum.
There are other methods using a Hubbard-like interaction, such as LDA+SO+U calculations.
The $U$ we found can then be compared to the one found through this methods. 
Furthermore it allows us to compare the strength of interaction effects in similar materials in relation to each other.

Numerical calculations were performed in two dimensions due to the layered structure of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, 
using a grid of size $256\times256$.
As a direct result from the discrete Fourier transformation, we get discrete momenta in the Brillouin zone.
The sum over momenta in Greens functions is therefore restricted to $256\times256$ values.
The magnetic susceptibility $\chi(\vec q,\omega)$ was calculated for different values of $\vec q$.
% path
We choose a path along the symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone, that covers the most interesting features of the dispersion.
Due to symmetry in the band structure energies $\varepsilon_{\vec k}$ and therefore in the energies $E^{\pm}_{\vec k}$ as well,
it is sufficient to restrict oneself to just a quarter of the Brillouin zone.
The most basic dependence on $\vec q$ is through a cosine, $\cos (q_i)$ or $\cos(2q_i)$, that is independent of the sign of the components $q_i$.
%
The path chosen for analysis of $\chi$ is a standard way of presenting calculations and measurements and makes it easy to compare our results to related work.
It covers four directions, which can be parametrized by $t$ ranging from 0 to 1.
First the border of the magnetic Brillouin zone perpendicular to the diagonal, $(\frac14(2-t),\frac14t$, 
then the $k_y$-direction along the border of the Brillouin zone, $(0,\frac12t)$,
the diagonal $(\frac12t,\frac12t)$
and finally 
the $k_x$-direction $(\frac12t,0)$ along the $k_y$-direction.
The path is shown in figure \ref{path}, together with the boundary of the reduced Brillouin zone.
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{../path}
  \caption{path through the Brillouin zone (blue), connecting S-X-M-S-$\Gamma$-X. The grey dotted line is the boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone.}
 \label{path}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
It connects the points $\Gamma=(0,0)$, M=($\frac12,\frac12$), S$=(\frac14,\frac14)$ and X=($\frac12,0$) in the order S-X-M-S-$\Gamma$-X.

The temperature was set to $T=0.0033$, corresponding to 10K at t=0.258eV.
This is a temperature  typically encountered in low-temperature experiments and was used in the measurements that provide our reference data. 
The Néel temperature for Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is at about 250K$^{\text{\cite{PhysRevB.49.9198}}}$.
Being far below the Néel temperature is necessary for our assumption of an anti-ferromagnetic ground state.
A low temperature is also needed in order to be able to describe the material with an one-band Hubbard model. 
Comparison of calculations over a wide range of temperatures up to 200K showed no significant dependence on the temperature except for the broadness of peaks.


In the calculation of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ we need to shift the frequencies infinitesimally above the real axis, 
in order to get a retarded response function. 
The small imaginary part of the frequencies are responsible for the imaginary part of $\chi$, which we then relate to the differential cross section. 
In the calculations we used complex frequencies $\omega^+ = \omega + \im \eta$ with a non-zero but small imaginary part $\eta$. 
Choosing a non-infinitesimal value however smears out the delta function, that arises in the limit $\eta \rightarrow 0$ in the imaginary part.
This can be used to compensate for discretisation effects due to the finite sized grid, because we get a contribution even if the delta function 
doesn't match one of the discretised momentum.
% don't repeat yourself here, see derivation of $\chi$ in chapter before.
%
The value has no physical meaning. It changes the broadness and height of the poles. 
It was chosen as small as possible, but big enough to ensure a smooth result for the response function with pronounced features.
Choosing this value to big would wash out the characteristic of the response function, making it hard to analyse.
The frequency dependency of propagators and Greens functions is mostly given by $(\omega^+-E^{\pm}_{\vec k})^{-1}$ and combinations thereof.
As a good starting point we can therefore take the maximum difference in the energies $E^{\pm}$ between to nearby points in the finite sized grid of momenta.
For our simplest dispersion, this occurs for example  between the momenta $\vec k_1 = (\pm \frac14,\pm\frac14)$ and $\vec k_2 = \vec k_1 + (\frac1{\sqrt{N}},0)$.
As an estimation we can take $U=4$ and $m=0.3$ at half filling as a set of typical values, see the discussion below.
We get $|E^{\pm}_{\vec k_1} - E^{\pm}_{\vec k_2}| = 0.001$ for momenta on a $256\times256$ grid.
Finally, we found $\eta=0.005$ to be an optimal value.
This value is of order $10^{-3}$ compared to the maximum $\omega(\vec q)$ encountered for typical values of $U$ used in this thesis.

In order to extract the spin wave dispersion, we calculated the imaginary part and plotted it as 
a colour map over $\vec q$ and $\omega$. 
The colour scale is dominated by the highest peaks of $\chi$.
In order to visualize the whole dispersion we had to choose a cut off for the highest values. 
The value was set individually for each calculation such, that it reveals the whole spectrum of possible excitations,
but such, that the position of the peaks are well defined. 
Areas that were set to the maximal value appear therefore slightly broader in the plot. 
The broadness of the peaks in general is much smaller than in the measurements we compared it to. 

\section{Staggered Magnetization At Half-Filling}
We need to fix the parameters $n_{\sigma}$ and $m_{s,\sigma}$ of the propagators.
They can be expressed through a sum of propagators itself, as shown in equations \ref{n_DEF} and \ref{m_DEF}.
This results in a system of four non-linear coupled equations.
At half filling with $\uparrow$-$\downarrow$-symmetry, they can be decoupled and therby be solved in a easier way. 

The number density is controlled by the chemical potential, which is another free parameter of the system.
The effective spin-$\frac12$ states in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ are half-filled, that is $n=1$. 
Because of the symmetry between up and down spins we have furthermore $n_{\uparrow}=n_{\downarrow} = \frac12$
This symmetry is not broken but rather assured by the anti-ferromagnetic ground state.

Due to particle-hole symmetry, the Hamiltonian should be invariant under the replacement 
$c_{\vec k,\sigma} \leftrightarrow c_{\vec k,\sigma}^{\dagger}$
% and $\varepsilon_{\vec k} \rightarrow -\varepsilon_{\vec k}$.
In doing this replacement and using the anti-commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators, the Hamilton operator in momentum space reads
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \hat H &=& \sum_{\vec k,\sigma} (-\varepsilon_{\vec k} + \mu) c_{\vec k ,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{\vec k,\sigma} 
 + \frac UN\sum_{\vec k,\vec k^{\prime}, \vec q} c_{\vec k,\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{\vec k - \vec q,\uparrow}c_{\vec k^{\prime},\downarrow} c_{\vec k^{\prime} + \vec q,\downarrow} 
 \nonumber \\ &&
 -U\sum_{\vec k} \left( c_{\vec k,\uparrow}^{\dagger}c_{\vec k, \uparrow} +c_{\vec k,\downarrow}^{\dagger}c_{\vec k, \downarrow} \right)
  + \sum_{\vec k} (2\varepsilon_{\vec k} + 2\mu + U) 
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The energy dispersion for holes is given by $\varepsilon_{\vec k}^{\mathrm{holes}} = -\varepsilon_{\vec k}$ 
and by this replacement we get back the original Hamiltonian for particles plus a constant, that does not change our system.
We can collect terms proportional to the total number of holes or particles, 
$nN= \sum_{\vec k,\sigma} c_{\vec k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{\vec k,\sigma}$. 
The pre-factor of this terms corresponds to the chemical potential for holes. 
At half-filling it should be the same as for particles, 
we find therefore
\begin{equation}
 \mu = U-\mu \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu = \frac{U}2.
\end{equation}
This allows us to insert $\mu = \frac U2$ and $n_{\sigma} = \frac12$ immediately in the half filled case.




We furthermore assume that $m_{s,\uparrow}=-m_{s,\downarrow}$. 
The staggered magnetization may thus be expressed by $m_s=2\sigma \cdot m_{s,\sigma}$.
This relation holds in a perfect anti-ferromagnetic state with at most one particle per site. 
Double occupied states on the other hand yield  contribution to $m_{s,\sigma}$, that is symmetric under for $\uparrow \leftrightarrow \downarrow$ in contrast to the 
otherwise asymmetric behaviour.
The expression for $m_{s,\sigma}$ adds $(-1)^i$  whenever a particle with spin $\sigma$ is present at site $i$. 
This is not affected by the simultaneous presence of a particle with spin $-\sigma$, 
which will only be seen by $m_{s,-\sigma}$ and will be weighted with the same factor of $(-1)^i$.
However, double occupancies can be expected to be distributed evenly throughout the system
and we might find as many on the sub-lattice with negative pre-factor as on the positive on.
For large systems we can therefore expect this contributions to vanish in the average over all sites.
This restores the antisymmetric relation between $m_{s,\uparrow}$ and $m_{s,\downarrow}$. 

As a direct result, $F_{\vec k,\sigma}$ depends only by an overall sign on $\sigma$, while the value of $G_{\vec k,\sigma}$ becomes spin independent,
\begin{equation}
 G_{\vec k,\uparrow} = G_{\vec k,\downarrow} \qquad F_{\vec k,\uparrow} =-F_{\vec k,\downarrow}.
\end{equation}




In order to calculate $m_ {s,\sigma}$ we solve equation \ref{m_DEF}, where we can replace $m_{s,\uparrow}$ by $-m_{s,\downarrow}$, as stated above.
We furthermore drop the spin labels on $E_{\vec p,\sigma}^{\pm}$, 
since they depend only on the absolute value of $m_{\sigma}$ and furthermore is $n_{\uparrow} = n_{\downarrow}$ as explained above.
This decouples the two equations with respect to the spin label.
By using the definition of the off-diagonal propagator $F_{\sigma,\vec{p}}$ we end up with
\begin{equation}
 m_{s,\sigma} = \frac1N \sum_{\vec{p}} \sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} 
							      \frac { Um_{s,\sigma} }
								    { (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec{p}}^+) (\im \omega_n - E_{\vec{p}})}
\end{equation}
The $m_{s,\sigma}$ on the LHS cancels the one in the RHS, but $E^{\pm}$ is still dependent on $|m_{s,\sigma}|$.
To deal with the summation over the Matsubara frequencies $\im \omega_n$, we use Cauchy's integral theorem as described in \ref{MFS}.
The resulting equation
\begin{equation}
 1= \frac{U}{N}\sum_{\vec{p}} \frac{1}{E_{\vec p}^+ - E_{\vec{p}}^-} \left( \frac{1}{1+\euler^{\beta E_{\vec p}^+}} - \frac{1}{1+\euler^{\beta E_{\vec p}^-}} \right)
\end{equation}
is solved using the Newton-Raphson method.
Figure \ref{ms_nn} shows an example of the behaviour of $m_s$ for different values of $U$. The dispersion in this calculation is based 
on nearest neighbour hopping only, that is $t^{\prime} = t^{\prime \prime} = 0$ on a two-dimensional square lattice.
Introducing non-zero $t^{\prime}$ and $t^{\prime \prime}$ showed the same dependency. 
%

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{../stagmag_T10.png}
 \caption{staggered magnetization as function of $\frac Ut$}
 \label{ms_nn} 
\end{figure}
%
In the limit of infinite $U$ we get $m_s=1$, corresponding to a fully anti-ferromagnetic ground state. 
The strong repulsive interaction prevents double occupancies, because each of them adds $U$ to the energy of the ground state.
We will find therefore at max one particle at each site. Half filling requieres then that there is actually a particle at each site. 
At the same time there are virtual hopping processes to the states of higher energy, which create  a possibility to further lower the ground state energy.
Virtual hopping between neighbouring sites is only possible if they are occupied by particles with opposite spin.
Otherwise it would be forbidden by the Pauli principle, which holds for virtual processes as well. 
Therefore, an anti-ferromagnetic ground state is energetically preferable to a ferromagnetic one.

Lowering $U$ yields a lower staggered magnetization, since the energy cost for double occupancy gets lower and might be out-weighted by
the reduce in kinetic energy due to hopping.
%
At some point we will encounter a transition to an unordered metallic ground state with $m_s=0$. 
The closing of the Hubbard gap leads to the transition from the insulating state to a conducting one.
The critical value for this transition is sensitive to the parameters for second- and third-neighbour hopping, 
even though the dependence of $m_s$ on $U$ above the critical value of $U$ is identical for non-zero and vanishing $t^{\prime}$ and $t^{\prime \prime}$.
The critical value was reported by \citet{PhysRevB.88.035111} to be in the range $U_c \approx 0.7 - 2.2$, depending of the precise set of parameters.
For lower values of $U$, our assumption of a Hubbard gap and an anti-ferromagnetic ground state is not valid any more
and our description is not capable of describing the physical situation any longer. 
The iterative procedure for $m_s$ is not converging in this situation any longer due to the high sensitivity on the band gap through the factor $(E^p_{\vec k} - E^-_{\vec k})^{-1}$.
This term is proportional to $\frac{1}{Um_s}$ for momenta with $\varepsilon_{\vec k} - \varepsilon_{\vec k+\vec Q} =0$.
This is exactly the condition for nesting with nesting vector $\vec Q$, which is present at least at some points.
Calculations down to $U=0.5$ show that the staggered magnetization falls off very fast for low $U$. 
The term $(E^+_{\vec k} -E^-_{\vec k})^{-1}$ diverges in this case and the iteration procedure becomes numerically unstable. 
The limitation for this calculation appears therefore for numerical reasons, that become dominant at roughly the value of the transition to the unordered state.

After calculating $m_{s}$, the expression for $n_{\sigma}$ in terms of the propagator $G_{\vec k,\sigma}$ has also been evaluated 
and found to be consistent with the above condition for the chemical potential at half-filling.



\section{Large U Limit}

A large $U$ drives the system in an anti-ferromagnet ground state as mentioned above. 
Hopping at half-filling leads to double occupancies, which are suppressed due to the high energetic cost of $U$. 
Therefore, the system can be described as an Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet in this limit.
The Heisenberg Hamiltonian with only nearest neighbour coupling is
\begin{equation}
 \hat H = J \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j,
\end{equation}
which will be an anti-ferromagnetic coupling for positive J. 
\todo{derivation of Heisenberg from Hubbard or reference}
Hopping will be treated as a distortion to the system and yields the interaction of neighbouring spins.

%

We will expand the expression for $\chi$ in terms of $\frac{t^2}{U}$ 
and compare the resulting dispersion with the linear spin-wave dispersion gained from a $\frac1S$ expansion of the Heisenberg model.
Since we are only interested in the position of the poles in $\chi$, it is sufficient to expand the denominator of equation \ref{ladder_sum} and solving for it's roots,
\begin{equation}
 \left(1+\lambda(x+y)\right)\left(1+\lambda(\bar x + y)\right) - \lambda^2(z_1 +z_2)^2 = 0
\end{equation}
We note first that the term $\lambda y$ is dominant in this limit, since $\lambda y \sim 1$, while $\lambda x \sim \frac1{U^2}$ and $\lambda z_i \sim \frac1U$
for infinite $U$.
Expanding this term
up to first order in  $\frac{t^2}U$ we are left with the dispersion
\begin{equation}\label{DispULimit}
 \omega(\vec q) = \frac{4t^2}{Um_s}\sqrt{4-(\cos q_x+\cos q_y)^2}. 
\end{equation}
This is exactly the spin wave dispersion one gets for linear spin waves in a Heisenberg antiferromagnet, 
with the coupling $J=\frac{4t^2}{Um_s}$.
Deriving the Heisenberg model from the Hubbard model yields $J=\frac{4t^2}{U}$, which differs by a factor of $\frac1{m_s}$ from the coupling we get in this expansion.
The dependence of $m_s$ on $U$ shows, that we get a perfect antiferromagnet with $m_s=1$ for large $U$, 
such that the two couplings will be identical in the case, where this approximations are valid. 
%

Linear spin waves are the first term in an $\frac1S$ expansion of the dispersion in a Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
Higher orders renormalize the spin wave dispersion by allowing for quantum fluctuations.
It was claimed by Peres et al. that the staggered magnetization in the expression for $\omega$ in equation \ref{DispULimit} 
plays the role of this renormalization factor \cite{PhysRevB.65.132404}.
Quantum fluctuations do lower the value of $m_s$, but in the mean field scheme it tends to 1 for large $\frac Ut$ 
and is unable to provide such corrections in the case of large $U$.

The expression for $\omega(\vec q)$ tells us imediatly, that we get a constant dispersion along the 
boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone, $\omega(\frac12(1-t), \frac12t) =\mathrm{const.}$ for $t \in [0,1]$.
% say sth. why \omega(\vec q = 0) = \omega(\vec q = \vec Q) = 0 is expected. 
% \omega = 0, \vec q = 0: G^2-F^2 = (G-F)^2 - 2GF; (G-F)^2 = 1, GF = z1 = -z2 or similar
% actually is z_1 = z_2 = 0, 1+\lambda(\bar x +y ) = 0 | \vec q =0


By using a large value for $U$ in our calculations, we get results that agree well with the unrenormalized case.
An example for $U=40$ can be seen in figure \ref{largeU}, together with the corresponding dispersion for linear spin waves.

\section{$t$-$U$-Model}

The $t$-$U$-Model is the simplest version of the Hubbard model.
In dimensionless units it contains $U$ as the only free model parameter.
The band structure is then only specified by the geometry of the lattice.
In the case of a square lattice, the band structure fulfils $\varepsilon_{\vec k} = -\varepsilon_{\vec k+\vec Q}$.
By this relation, the energies $E^{\pm}$ of the new bands reduce at half filling to a much simpler form,
\begin{equation}
 E^{\pm}_{\vec k} = \pm \sqrt{\varepsilon_{\vec k}^2 -U^2m_{s,\sigma}^2}.
\end{equation}
The energies along the path through the previously defined Brillouin zone are shown in figure \ref{Epmt47}.
The two bands are split by a gap of width $Um_s$. 
They are completely symmetric to the Fermi surface and the energy along the boundary of the reduced Brillouin zone is constant.
%
\begin{figure}
 \centering

 \caption{$E^{\pm}_{\vec q}$ for the $t$-$U$-model with $U=4.7t$. $\vec q$ follows the path in figure \ref{path}. }
 \label{Epmt47}
\end{figure}


Such a model was used by \citet{PhysRevB.65.132404} to calculate the spin wave dispersion of La$_2$CuO$_4$, the cuprate analogue to Sr$_2$IrO$_4$.
They could successfully reproduce the spin wave dispersion measured by inelastic neutron scattering. 
The parameters found were $t_{\mathrm{cup}}=0.295$eV and $U_{\mathrm{cup}}=6.1\cdot t_{\mathrm{cup}}=1.8$eV. 
We use an extended version of their calculation scheme and adjusted it to the specifications found in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$.
In the first approach we  use the same simple one parameter band structure, based on nearest neighbour hopping only.

The spin wave dispersions of both materials show a very similar qualitative behaviour.
The most characteristic difference is the dispersion along the boundary of the reduced Brillouin zone, e.g. the line S-X in figure \ref{path}.
The ratio of frequencies at S and X,
\begin{equation} 
r = \frac{ \omega(\frac14,\frac14) }{ \omega(\frac12,0) }. 
\end{equation}
provides a quantitative measure of this effect. 
In the La$_2$CuO$_4$ the ratio is relatively large with an value of $r = 0.85$, compared to $r=0.54$ in
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$.

$r$ increases with $U$ and reaches eventually $r=1$ 
in the Heisenberg limit.
In this case, the dispersion is constant along this line.
The Heisenberg model with nearest neighbour couplings corresponds to an expansion up to first order in $\frac tU$ only, 
i.e. only terms proportional to $\frac {t^2}{U}$ are taken into account.
As we lower the interaction strength, higher order terms become more important.
The Heisenberg model can reproduce a lowered value for $r$ only if interactions between higher order neighbours are introduced.
They arise from  hopping processes over multiple sites.
They gain a pre-factor proportional to $t\cdot(\frac tU)^n$  for $n+1$ hopping processes.
These terms become more important, as we lower $U$. 
Expanding to second order yields  the couplings \cite{0022-3719-10-8-031} 
\begin{equation}
 J = 4\frac{t^2}{U} -24\frac{t^4}{U^3}; \qquad J^{\prime} = J^{\prime \prime} = 4\frac{t^4}{U^3}; \qquad J_c = 80 \frac{t^4}{U^3}.
\end{equation}

i.e. hopping of a particle over four sites such that it ends up at the site where it started. 
Especially the ring exchange seems to contribute to the dispersion along the zone boundary \cite{PhysRevLett.86.5377}.
Particles in the Hubbard model are mobile due to the hopping term and there is no restriction to certain exchanges.
%
%
%
Even though  hopping processes up to infinite order are taken into account,
we found that the Hubbard model based on nearest neighbour hopping only is not capable of describing the dispersion observed in experiments.
An explanation can be found in the constant band energy at the border of the reduced Brillouin zone.
The most important contributions stem from areas close to the Fermi surface. 
At the same time remains $E^{\pm}_{\vec k + \vec q}$ constant for $\vec q$ in this area.

Choosing $U=4.7 = 1.2$eV provides the best description of the spin wave dispersion along most parts of the path.
A comparison with measurements can be seen in figure \ref{tU47}.

The spin wave velocity at $c=\left. \frac{\dint \omega}{\dint \vec k} \right|_{\vec k = 0}$ is well described after renormalization.
With the same renormalization factor the dispersion along
the zone boundary of the whole Brillouin zone, namely from X to M, is represented at a high level of agreement.
The model fails however to catch the lowered dispersion at the Fermi surface, e.g. around $\vec q = (\frac 14, \frac14)$.
The calculated dispersion is way to high, giving us therefore a ratio of $r=0.8$. 
It is possible to get to lower values of $r$ for smaller $U$, but the resulting dispersion fails then to match the spin wave velocity and 
the total energy scale. An value as low as the one found in the iridates will not be reached for any value of $U$ above the critical value.


In addition to this excitations, where $\omega$ has a clear functional dependence on $\vec q$, 
we find an area of continuous excitations.
The continuum begins at energies, comparable to the band gap between $E^+_{\vec k}$ and $E^-_{\vec k}$ and 
stretches mainly over an area of two times the band width of $E^{\pm}_{\vec k}$.
The continuum corresponds to the excitation of an electron into the otherwise unoccupied upper energy band $E^+_{\vec k}$.
The effect of the canted structure can be seen by the small intensities around the point M, that  shifted  from $\Gamma$ with 
a weight of $\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \Theta}$.
The emergence of the continuum is closely related to mathematical expression of $\chi$. 
In calculating bubble diagrams, one encounters sums over terms like $(E^{-}_{\vec p} +\omega - E^+_{\vec p + \vec q})^{-1}$.
They are suppressed by an factor of $(1+\euler^{E^-_{\vec k} T})^{-1}$, but
for $\omega$ larger than the band gap, but lower than the maximum difference between the bands, their denominator vanishes for certain $\omega$ 
and they can give a big contribution to the sum over such expressions for different momenta. 
In experiment the continuum begins around 0.5eV \cite{PhysRevLett.86.5377}, which is of the same magnitude, but less then the lower bound found in our calculations.
Furthermore, the lower bound of continuous excitations is not a straight line as it is in our calculations. 
This indicates that the model is to much simplified and missing therefore some essential features.
At these energy scales there are further excitations possible, for example excitations to the $J=\frac32$ states, which are not covered by our calculation scheme.
Around the critical value $U_c$, the continuum merges with the spin wave excitations. 
In experiments we find a large gap between the low energy excitations and the continuum, which indicates a $U$ well above the critical value. 

Looking at the contributions of the transversal ($\chi^{zz}$) and longitudinal ($\chi^{+-}$) component of the susceptibility separately reveals 
that the spin wave dispersion at lower energies is determined by $\chi^{+-}$ completely.

	 \label{Xcomponents}
\end{figure}
%
As can be seen in figure \ref{Xcomponents}, contributions of $\chi^{zz}$ to the excitation spectrum lie solely in the continuum,
where the longitudinal susceptibility actually dominates.
Excitations in the longitudinal direction are only possible, when the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of the ground state 
is distorted, which comes with a energetic cost, that increases with $U$.

\section{$t$-$t^{\prime}$-$t^{\prime \prime}$-$U$-Model}

In the previous chapter we saw that an approach with only nearest neighbour interactions  is not capable of reproducing all the observed features 
in the magnetic excitations of this Sr$_2$IrO$_4$.
In order to gain a better model, we improve the band structure by taking hopping terms to second and third neighbours into account. 
This provides a more realistic description of the system and allows us to reproduce the observed spin wave dispersion.



The hopping parameters $t,t^{\prime},t^{\prime \prime}$ were treated as fixed external parameters.
This means they were taken from first principle calculations done by 
\citet{PhysRevLett.106.136402} rather than adjusted to experiments.
We use again $t$ as the basic  energy unit and express other parameters in terms of it.
There are therefore to new parameters entering the calculations, the ratios $\nicefrac{t^{\prime}}{t}$ and $\nicefrac{t^{\prime \prime}}{t}$, further denoted by $t^{\prime}$ and 
$t^{\prime \prime}$ only. 
Normalizing reduces not only the number of parameters, the ratio of neighbour interactions can be calculated, while 
their absolute value has to be fitted to measurements, producing a higher uncertainty \cite{PhysRevB.67.064504}.

Their values are based on fits to a multi orbital tight binding model that includes all the $t_{2g}$ states together with the hybridization with the $p$ orbitals from the 
ligands.
The couplings between these orbitals were then fitted to reproduce the band dispersion that was calculated in the linear density approximation (LDA) including SOC. 
After a projection to the spin-$\frac12$ subspace, we get the effective couplings of between sites in our one orbital Hubbard model.
The values used in this thesis were

%
The last line shows the normalized values.
With those parameters the band structure of a square lattice is 
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon_{\vec k } = -2t \left(\cos k_x + \cos k_y \right) -4t^{\prime} \cos k_x \cos k_y  -2t^{\prime \prime} \left( \cos 2k_x + \cos 2k_y \right)
\end{equation}s
as explained in chapter \ref{chapter_bandstructure}.



The second and third neighbour hopping parameters are substantially smaller than $t$, but big enough to change the 
results significantly. 
 The most important feature is the removal of the degeneracy in $E^{\pm}_{\vec k}$ along the border of the reduced Brillouin zone.
This was the reasons, why the $t$-$U$-model was not capable of reproducing the spin wave dispersion. 
In figure \ref{tttE42} we plotted again the energies of $E^{\pm}_{\vec q}$ along the same path as before.
\begin{figure}
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{../Edispttt44}
 \caption{$E^{\pm}_{\vec q}$ in the extended model ,that includes second and third neighbour hopping terms.
 $U$ was chosen to be 4.4,
 $\vec q$ follows the path through the Brillouin zone described in figure \ref{path}. }
 \label{tttE42}
\end{figure}
The gap between the upper and lower band is smaller than in the previous case, where it was given by $Um_s$.
At the same time the bands stretch over a larger energy range.





The $t$-$t^{\prime}$-$t^{\prime \prime}-$Hubbard model, 
is capable of describing all features of the measured dispersion to a high level of agreement. 
The optimal value for the Hubbard interaction was found to be $U=4.4=1.1eV$.
The value was optimized in several runs by guidance of the eye, until the experimental values were met.
With the renormalization due to quantum fluctuations a very high level of agreement could be achieved, see figure \ref{tttU42}.

Again, the spin wave velocity and the dispersion along X-M and $\Gamma$-X is very well described. 
Furthermore the ratio $r$ of energies at $\vec q = (\frac14,\frac14)$ and $(\frac12,0)$ is almost completely matched.
At $\vec q = (\frac14,\frac14)$ and in its direct vicinity the dispersion is overestimated.
This results in a larger value of $r$ as well, since $\omega(\frac12,0)$ is matched exactly.
$\omega(\frac14,\frac14)$ and therefore $r$ is overestimated by 5\%, 
which is small compared to the broadness of the peak in this measurements. 



The staggered magnetization at $U=4.4$ was found to be $m_s= 0.73$. 
As mentioned above, there is a net ferromagnetic moment proportional to the anti-ferromagnetic ordering 
parameter $m_s$, because of the canted orientation of the oxygen octahedra. 
We found for the magnetic ordering parameter $m =  \sin \Theta m_s= 0.139$. 
It is related to the total magnetic moment by the magnetic moment of a single site, that is $g\mu_b J$,
with the gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$ of an electron and the spin $J=\frac12$ as the total angular momentum. 
The observed ferromagnetic moment is $0.14\mu_b$ \cite{PhysRevB.57.R11039}. 
Our result is therefore in good agreement, given the magnetic moment of $1\mu_b$ at each Ir site. 
The canted structure provides therefore a good explanation of the observed weak ferromagnetic moment 
without any ferromagnetic ordering in the ground state.

Another quantity, that is closely related to the Hubbard-$U$ is the width of the Mott gap.
The Mott gap is the split of the $J=\frac12$-band due to the repulsive Hubbard interaction into the bands denoted by $E^{\pm}_{\vec k}$ respectively. 
With the optimal value of $U$ found in  our calculation and the corresponding staggered magnetization $m_s$, 
the width of the band gap is given by $\Delta_{\mathrm{Mott}}=1.6t=0.47\mathrm{eV}$.
This is close to, but slightly lower than the experimental result of 0.54eV  at $T=10$K,
as found through optical spectroscopic measurements by \citet{PhysRevB.80.195110}.


With the changed dispersion the continuous excitations at higher energies show agree with experiment on a qualitative level. 
The dispersion for both is compared in \ref{continuum}.

 \centering

\label{continuum}	  
\end{figure}
Due to the changed energy bands, it has no longer a constant sharp boundary at the lower end, but shows $\vec k$-dependence as well.
A quantitative comparison of the excitations is difficult, since the experimental data contains  spin orbit excitations as well. Those lie in the centre 
of the continuous band.
On a qualitative level we note that the bulges at the low energy end of the continuum are appear for the same momenta as in the measurements. 
The lowest excitations are found at $\vec q = (\frac14,\frac14)$. This is the momentum transfer that connects the $\vec k$ for the highest value of $E^-_{\vec k}$ with the 
momentum, where $E^+_{\vec k}$ is minimal, as one would expect for such excitations.




% compare to J-J-J and explain why it is better
% look up J in t-t'-t''-U expansion




\citet{PhysRevLett.108.177003} did not only measure the inelastic scattering cross section, they provided also a model to describe the data.
Their model is the Heisenberg model with up to third neighbour couplings, with the parameters $J$, $J^{\prime}$ and $J^{\prime \prime}$ for
the first, second and third neighbour exchange couplings respectively, without an parameter for cyclic exchange. 
All three parameters were treated as free parameters and fitted to the measured spin wave dispersion. 
The values were found to be $J=60$meV, $J^{\prime}=-20$meV and $J^{\prime\prime}=15$meV. 
The resulting dispersion reproduces the right energies at the points X and S and therefore the right $r$ as well,
while the energies along the path connecting these points are systematically underestimated.



In an effective model the effect of cyclic exchange can be absorbed in the other parameters.
$J$ and $J^{\prime}$ will be lowered by that, while $J^{\prime \prime}$ remains unchanged. 
As an expansion of the Hubbard model, these parameters are related through their dependence on $t,t^{\prime},t^{\prime \prime}$ and $U$.
Up to second order, they are given by
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{ccc}
 J= 4\frac{t^2}{U} - 64 \frac{t^4}{U^3} = 41\mathrm{meV} &
 ,\qquad J^{\prime} =4\frac{t^{\prime 2}}{U}-16\frac{t^4}{U^3} = -38\mathrm{meV} \nonumber \\
  J^{\prime \prime}= 4\frac{t^{\prime \prime 2}}{U}+  4\frac{t^3}{U^4} = 15\mathrm{meV}.&
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
where we the values found above for $U$ and $t,t^{\prime},t^{\prime \prime}$.
These values do not agree very well with the fit and show that their parameters do not follow the functional dependence on the parameters of the Hubbard model.
The Hubbard model shows to describe the dispersion with a higher accuracy. 
At the same it has just one free parameter, while the other can be obtained by first principle calculations.


% interpret value of U, compare to cuprates and literature: lower than usually 


Our optimal value for $U=4.4$ corresponding to 1.1eV, is substantially lower than the one found in the similar cuprate compounds.
In the cuprates $U$ is usually set to around 7$t_{\mathrm{Cu}}$ for the corresponding $t_{\mathrm{Cu}}=0.3$eV \cite{PhysRevB.65.132404}.
This is expected, since the $5d$ orbitals are more extended, which reduces the intra orbital interaction.
In the literature the Hubbard interaction is often estimated to be $U=2$eV \cite{PhysRevB.80.075112}. 
Our calculations shows that the interaction is weaker and $U=1.1$eV yields a more realistic description of the system.

The transition from a Mott insulator to a paramagnetic metal is dependent on the strength of the SOC. 
With $\lambda = 1.1t$ the critical value of a multi orbit model is $U_c=3.3t$ \cite{PhysRevB.105.216410}, Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is therefore 
in the  anti-ferromagnetic phase, but close to the metal insulator transition. 
Using Rh instead of Ir increases $U$, but reduces $\lambda$ at the same time. 
A larger $U$ on the one hand increases the band gap, with a low lambda however we do not necessarily have the 
effective spin-$\frac12$ states anymore. 
This is the case in Sr$_2$RhO$_4$ and as a result it is a paramagnetic metal.
This shows the importance of strong SOC for the properties of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. 
It further supports  the statement, that Sr$_2$IrO$_4$  experiences the effects of both types of mechanisms to create insulators,
the charge interaction driven Mott type and the Slater type, which is based on magnetic ordering \cite{PhysRevB.89.165115}.
A contribution from the Slater scenario might provide an explanation, why our calculated band gap is not big enough.

\section{Matsubara Frequency Summation} \label{MFS}

In the calculations above we encounter functions of the type 
$ \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} f(\im \omega_n)$.
$f$ is usually a propagator or a function of propagators. 
We require $F$ to vanish fast at infinity, that is $|f(z)|< \frac1z\rightarrow 0$ for $|z|\rightarrow \infty$ 
The Matsubara frequencies can be fermionic or bosonic, depending on the type of operator they describe.
For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ they are given by
\begin{equation}
 \im \omega_n = \left\{ \begin{array}{l @{\quad}c} (2n+1)\im \frac{\pi }{\beta} & \text{(fermionic)} \\ 2n\im\frac{ \pi}{\beta} & \text{(bosonic)} \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
The Matsubara frequencies are the poles of the function
\begin{equation}
h(z) = \frac{\beta}{\euler^{\beta z} \pm 1} 
\end{equation}
with the positive sign for fermions and the negative one for bosonic frequencies. 
Using Cauchys integral theorem, we can express the sum over the frequencies as an integral. 
We choose a contour $\gamma_1$ that encloses the imaginary axis counterclockwise in a way, that it avoids any other poles not on the axis.
This means running paralell to the axis on a very small distance and closing it at infinity.
% reference to picture. green?
We can now blow up this countour to a circel with inifinite radius which we shall call $\gamma_2$.
Since the function vanishes fast, the integral will be 0, but we have to pick up the Residual of every pole we encounter in deforming the countour. 
The poles will be encircled clockwise, which gives rise to a minus sign.
% reference to the blown up contour. blue?
In doing so, we get the relation
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \sum_{n \in \mathbb Z} f(\im \omega_n) &=& \frac1{2\pi\im} \oint_{\gamma_1} \!\!\dint z \: f(z)\cdot h(z) \nonumber \\
 &=&  \frac1{2\pi\im}\underbrace{\oint_{\gamma_2} \!\! \dint z \: f(z)\cdot h(z)}_{=0} -\sum_{i} f(z_i)\cdot h(z_i) 	\\ 
 && \text{for }i \in \{z\in \mathbb{C} | z\text{ pole of} f\} \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}



The functions used here usually have poles on the real axis. 
With choosing the contour close enough to the imaginary axis we keep those outside of the enclosed area.
For functions falling off faster than $\frac{1}{|z|^{1+\delta}}$ $(\delta>0)$ as $|z|\rightarrow \infty$ we can blow up the contour to a
circle with infinite radius. The integral will vanish, but we pick up residuals for every pole of $f$.
In total we get
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} f(\im \omega_n) = \frac{1}{2\pi \im} \int_0 \dint z f(z)\frac{\beta}{1+\euler^{\beta z }} 
 = \sum_{\mathrm{Res}_f} \left. \frac{f(z)\beta}{1+\euler^{\beta z }}\right|_{z=z_{\mathrm{Res}_f}}
\end{equation}
