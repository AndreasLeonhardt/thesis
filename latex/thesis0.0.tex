\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we investigated magnetic excitations in the iridate compound \Sriro.
As a layered strongly correlated system it can be described by the two-dimensional one-band Hubbard model, 
describing interacting particles in effective spin-$\frac12$ states.
Based on the previously calculated band structure model, it becomes an effective model with one free parameter, the one-site interaction strength $U$.
Using Green's functions at the mean field level, we calculated the dynamic magnetic susceptibility
and thereby the spin wave dispersion.
We compared the spin wave dispersion with resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments and used it to fit the Hubbard interaction strength $U$. 
We found the $t$-$t^{\prime}$-$t^{\prime\prime}$-$U$-Hubbard model based on the band structure energies
to provide a good description of the spin wave dispersion for $U=1.1\mathrm{eV}$.

\chapter{Matsubara Frequency Summation} \label{MFS}

In the calculations above we encounter functions of the type 
$ \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} f(\im \omega_n)$.
$f$ is usually a propagator or a function of propagators. 
We require $F$ to vanish fast at infinity, that is $|f(z)|< \frac1z\rightarrow 0$ for $|z|\rightarrow \infty$ 
The Matsubara frequencies can be fermionic or bosonic, depending on the type of operator they describe.
For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ they are given by
\begin{equation}
 \im \omega_n = \left\{ \begin{array}{l @{\quad}c} (2n+1)\im \frac{\pi }{\beta} & \text{(fermionic)} \\ 2n\im\frac{ \pi}{\beta} & \text{(bosonic)} \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
The Matsubara frequencies are the poles of the function
\begin{equation}
h(z) = \frac{\beta}{\euler^{\beta z} \pm 1} 
\end{equation}
with the positive sign for fermions and the negative one for bosonic frequencies. 
Using Cauchy's integral theorem, we can express the sum over the frequencies as an integral. 
We choose a contour $\gamma_1$ that encloses the imaginary axis counterclockwise in a way, that it avoids any other poles not on the axis, see figure \ref{cont}.
This means running parallel to the axis on a very small distance and closing it at infinity.

We can now blow up this contour to a circle with infinite radius which we shall call $\gamma_2$.
Since the function vanishes fast, the integral will be 0, but we have to pick up the Residual of every pole we encounter in deforming the contour. 
The poles will be encircled clockwise, which gives rise to a minus sign.
% reference to the blown up contour. blue?
In doing so, we get the relation
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
 \sum_{n \in \mathbb Z} f(\im \omega_n) &=& \frac1{2\pi\im} \oint_{\gamma_1} \!\!\dint z \: f(z)\cdot h(z) \nonumber \\
 &=&  \frac1{2\pi\im}\underbrace{\oint_{\gamma_2} \!\! \dint z \: f(z)\cdot h(z)}_{=0} -\sum_{i} f(z_i)\cdot h(z_i) 	\\ 
 && \text{for }i \in \{z\in \mathbb{C} | z\text{ pole of} f\} \nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}



The functions used here usually have poles on the real axis. 
With choosing the contour close enough to the imaginary axis we keep those outside of the enclosed area.
For functions falling off faster than $\frac{1}{|z|^{1+\delta}}$ $(\delta>0)$ as $|z|\rightarrow \infty$ we can blow up the contour to a
circle with infinite radius. The integral will vanish, but we pick up residuals for every pole of $f$.
In total we get
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} f(\im \omega_n) = \frac{1}{2\pi \im} \int_0 \dint z f(z)\frac{\beta}{1+\euler^{\beta z }} 
 = \sum_{\mathrm{Res}_f} \left. \frac{f(z)\beta}{1+\euler^{\beta z }}\right|_{z=z_{\mathrm{Res}_f}}
\end{equation}
